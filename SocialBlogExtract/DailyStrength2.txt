when I was younger I did a lot of drugs. In jr high I took a lot of pills and started drinking. when I was 13 I overdosed by taking 13 Valium, some Vicodin and some other random household pills. when I got to high school I started drinking and taking ecstasy. I also did coke for a little while. I went through my little drug phase until i was about 18 but I still get cravings to just go get high off of anything. When I stopped doing drugs I started drinking a lot. I was blacked out drunk every night for about 3 and half weeks. Looking back, drugs and alcohol probably was not the best thing in the world for me but I want that high so bad. I loved not feeling a damn thing. I smoke weed now because I figure that will at least get me a high feeling and not cause a whole lot of damage.. but its not the same as doing pills or e or coke.. I miss those highs.
im afraid this feeling will never go away. my roommate has Vicodin our room... I really want some but its been over a year since I've taken pills. My good friend sells coke and can get me e really easily... I hate these temptations. I want it all so bad!

I'm going to be honest with you.
You are getting high so that you don't have to feel ANYTHING.

Eventually, this won't work anymore, and your problems will be worse.

It's up to you. A clean and sober life with a purpose, or a life where you get numb from your troubles, run away and don't experience this amazing live we've been given.

Stop smoking pot or any other mind altering substances. THEN tell us how you feel. You may be surprised that you get some motivation back.

Good Luck

I know I get high just so I don't have to feel anything but I haven't figured out how to handle things when I can feel. I should have explained a little better because I don't smoke pot all the time.. most the time I only smoke to go to sleep or when I am feeling extra down.
As for living a sober life.. I don't remember what a sober life is like and I'm not sure if I'm ready to live a sober life and deal with depression at the same time. I know its counter productive but right now its the only thing that has the ability of getting me through the day.
Thanks for you reply.

You use pot and want to use stronger drugs because you are in pain--physical, emotional, or spiritual. You have been through a lot and like me you need healing. Some people like to moralize about drug use because they weren't traumatized as we were and are. It is best to not be addicted to anything and if that is all you smoke I wouldn't sweat that. Look up addiction in the dictionary and you will see my picture. I have been through tons but am doing well now and my pain is becoming visible and I am working through it. Hang in there my friend.

I won't even pretend I have any advice or even a grasp of what you are going through. I just wanted to say how impressive your efforts to get clean are! Even without those 'oh too easy temptations' what you have accomplished should be celebrated and applauded. Strength isn't not being tempted. Strength is making the right choice in the face of those temptations. Bravo!!99

Believe it or not, I lived through the '60's never using drugs....not even grass. I was already messed up enough without adding street drugs to my problems. I have come to believe that psychiatric drugs, under the supervision of a Doctor of course, are the only way to try and get mental illnesses under control.

Ok terrible confession to make.
Up until i was 3 months pregnant i still didnt know if i wanted to keep the baby, and ill admit i think on 4 seperate occasions i have had a few binges with my friends to sort of block the thought of being pregnant.
The last time was about 2 months ago and since then i just cant it out of my head. I have heard the babies heart several times since this and seen her on the scan and everythign looks fine, and surely if there was a problem the midwife would say?

But im so scared that i have hurt my baby daughter in someway, im terrified by my own stupidity and selfishness i may of caused long term damage....

i know many people may judge me when reading this and i know i have no excuse, but i didnt know whether i wanted the baby, ant had been sent to jail, my mum and dad live so far away and i didnt feel like i could talk to anyone, having a few lines of cocaine or bomb of speed made me numb to the feelings.
I just feel so ashamed but i needed to ask opinions because i dont feel like i can tell my midwife i just know what she will think of me!

At least you are able to admit your mistakes which doesnt make it right but no one has the right to judge you we all make mistakes and many we wish we could take back however the past is the past and we cant chnge that the only thing we can control is our futures and I hope you baby is fine but only time will tell because sometimes babies can be born addictted which I dont think will happen in this case but just remember you are strong to admit you where wrong and that is all that matters. God~Bless and Good~Luck!

Honestly.. I think that stopping when yuo did is better than still doing it. i think beating yourself up about it for the rest of the pregnancy will do more damage than good. From the things that i have read use of these substances can inhibit fetal growth for one.. cause miscarriages for another. there are alot of issues.. you are what about 5 months along now? I would think that any issues would be able to be seen by now, however i am not a dr. In my opinion, I would care less about what my midwife thought about my previous use and be more concerned about the effects on the baby. I dont think there is room for judgement when you come here or to a dr. In my opinion, you are looking for help and that is what matters. Please do the right thing by your child and talk with your midwife or dr. Let us know how it goes. Good Luck and God Bless.

I think the main thing is that you have stopped and that you are now being as healthy as you can be for the baby. Sounds like you were going through a difficult time and have alot of stress in your life. You realized that you had to make a change and you did. You are human and made a mistake that you feel guilty about. If everything with your baby has been good so far that's a good sign. You probably won't know if there is any damage until the baby is born or once he/she is developing. I hope you realize how courageous you are for admitting this and I really admire you for stopping any drug use for your health and your baby's health. My advice is to forgive yourself and be as healthy as you can the rest of your pregnancy, best of luck!

i know now it was stupid and i intend to make it up to my daughter for the rest of her life by being the best strongest mum she could ever ask for.

I think you need to tell your midwife about what happened so incase there is further tests that should be done. Even if you feel guilty and no matter wat she feels, it doesnt matter, its for the safety and health of your own little girl. Hope there is no serious damage. And I am glad you quit when you did.
And from your last post, in my opinion no matter if you do it once a year or everyday, you are still an addict, other wise why would you keep using. But im glad you were able to give it up, for a lot of people its just not so easy.
Hope all is well. Take care.

It doesn't matter what the midwife will think of you. You know you made a mistake and know you realize that you have to think about your baby. Tell the midwife about your drug use. The doctors ask about any drug or alcohol use for a reason, they need to know your history.

There is nothing you can do about the past, but you can do plenty about the present and the future.

At your next appointment think only about the baby and tell your midwife.

You should be proud of yourself for admitting what you did, and also for caring about what happens to your little one.

You are not the first mom to have made a mistake, and remember you won't be the last. The important thing is to learn from them and to try not to make the same mistake twice.

Good Luck, and don't beat yourself up about this, but again, do tell your midwife/doctor.

Hugs,103

Its a bitch aint it having to try all sort of different things until you come up with just the right mix and then unfortunaly alot of the time months or years down the road your body goes out of whack and what was working no longer does the job.

The problem is what works for one of us isnt a guaranteed fix for anyone else. I have been on so many pysch meds thruout the years and am down to pdoc just winging it alot of the time and repeating meds already tried but now at different doses in hopes of keeping my manic ass somewhat stable.

Hang in there hopefully you will find a right med combo soon and come hang out with us when it gets tough. BTW welcome

I am on Epilim as my mood stabilizer and then an anti-depressant called Venlafaxine. This combination is by far the best I have tried and would be happy to remain on these medications for a long time :)

In the past, I tried Lithium-which made me sluggish.
Also Olanzapine-which made me very sluggish, and put on
over 2 Stone :(

I do hope the meds I am on now will keep doing a great job for my bipolar, but it is still very early days yet.

Depends what your dx is? &amp; yes trial &amp; error comes with the territory

Bp2 with lots of depression 'may' benefit from a med like lamictal (good for lows) or lithium with various add ons for other symptoms
some take antidepressants, too.

bp1 the first line treatments are lithium, tegretol, trileptal, depakote (mood stabilisers that are particularly good for mania/mixed states) with adjunct (for psychosis, mania etc) abilify, zyprexa risperdal etc generally

&amp; the various sleeping pills, anxiety meds sprinkled on top

I have BP 1 and take Lamictal, Wellbutrin and Abilify, and sometimes Klonopin in case of emergency.

Well, I know that ciagettes and caffeine and alcohol is bad for PKD patients. The marijuana I have no clue about the effects. I have heard that the caffeine makes the cysts grow faster. I am not sure if there is research to back that up or not. My doctor told me so I am taking his word for it. The cigarettes elevate your blood pressure which I do know for a fact is the worste thing for your kidneys. Control your blood pressure always. If its good keep checking on it regularly, if its high get on meds asap. If you are on meds make sure you check to always make sure its a normal read. Stay on top of your blood pressure. I dont know why the alcohol is bad, I just know it is. Maybe it elevates your BP as well.

Vices vs. Life. You choose.

Food is another restriction. Don't eat anything in extremes. Bitter, sweet, salty, or spicy (especially spicy!). Anything that can cause a bump in BP should be avoided. You'll have to keep it dull, but that doesn't mean boring.

I prefer natural meds to chemical meds. I spent 4 months with a chinese doctor to bring a 156/92 to a consistant average of 135/82.

Here's what I found on the net.
10 tricks to lower your blood pressure
1. Check it
You can't do much about your blood pressure unless you know what it is. Your doctor should check it at every visit. Measuring at home between visits is even better.
2. Get moving
Exercise can lower bp by 10 points, prevent the onset of high bp or let you reduce your dosage of bp meds.
3. Eat right
A diet for better bp emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts.
4. Control you weight
If you are overweight, losing weight can lower bp.
5. Don't smoke
Smoking a cigarette can cause a 20 point spike in systolic bp.
6. Drink alcohol in moderation
Going beyond a drink a day can contribute to higher bp.
7. Shake up your salts
Too much sodium and too little potassium can boost bp. Aim for less than 1.5 grams of sodium a day and at least 4.7g of potassium from fruits and vegetables.
8. Sleep is good
Chronic lack of sleep can contribute to high bp. Get at least 6 hours a night.
9. Reduce stress
Mental and emotional stress can raise bp. Meditation and deep breathing can lower it.
10. Stick with your meds
Taking med can keep you from having a stroke or heart attack.

Also, low-fat milk on a low-fat diet lowers bp. Diet or regular cola, not coffee, can increase the risk of high bp especially in women. Worst day of the week is Monday (stress from starting the work week). Cranberry juice supports urinary function (which supports kidney function).

Addressing the symptoms, will delay the disease but it's no cure. Just stay as healthy as you can.

Post:
I went to a pdoc to get onto a proper anti depressant. I didn't go for any other reason, although it was for a long term nagging depression. But, I attribute it to where I am living (i hate it) and problems with bad marriage. I don't have bipolar, that is not why I went in to see her.

Anyways, she added another anti depressant to the one I was on already and I went in and told her it was making me too relaxed and I think it makes me feel bit sedated. I don't like it.

I have to say I also told her another time that I have self harmed about 4 times in my life... I'm almost 50. So, she added that up with me explaining some of the problems with husband.. remember he had the breakdown and his problems have made me a wreck. He said and did things that made me think bizarre things that he had done. I think he was psychotic for a while. Anyways, now the pdoc thinks those things are not believeable.... that's what I thought too..... I'm not saying they are or aren't. But, when you are dealing with someone that has mental health issues..... it's hard to live and deal with what is real and not with them. Anyways, cause I told her I was a bit confused on these pills, and just telling her about these things, she now thinks I am possibly dilusional or something. Possibly bipolar. She wanted to add abilify or something for me. My symptoms are just nagging depression.

She is going to call husband and see if she can get permission to view his mental health file. And she wants him to come in so she can decipher if he is lying or I am dillusional. I cannot believe this. Unreal. So, I am not going to take this medication anymore and go back in next time and I'm going to think a lot more clearly. I

I've heard that anti depressants can cause mania if you are bipolar, but I'm not manic,and never have been. I was just too relaxed, don't like the feeling. I don't have rages, don't spend money, don't get hypersexual. Um... gee but husband was like that a while back. She is wrong.... now I feel like I'm on guard here. How can this happen.

Sometimes you can have bipolar symptoms but it mostly be depression. I forget what they call that. If you don't like it though I would see another dr or just do what you are going to do and not take the meds that you don't want to. I have a dr that is always afraid of giving meds cause I have a tendancy to take too many because of the voices in my head. I did that the other day and now I don't know what he is going to do. So I kind of have the opposite problem.

I would see another doctor.

I can't help thinking that if the only evidence for you being bipolar is if something did or didn't happen with your husband and needs to be evidenced by looking at his records - that is shaky evidence for bipolar.

It's true that you might not have rages, spend or get hypersexual if you are bipolar - but there should be something concrete, that either you have noticed yourself or other people will have said to you (like you talk too fast, you are confusing people etc etc).

I think you are right to question this.

my doctor says that to be diagnosed with bipolar you need to have had at least 1 manic episode in your life,,, however it could be a mild form like cyclothymia??

I would get a second opinion from a diff pdoc.

I think your doctor is inquisitive which is good. She is doing her homework by getting permission to go through your husband's records to investigate and piece this together (a lot of effort on her part). Seems like she doesn't want to make a diagnosis without double checking what is going on. If you were severely delusional you probably wouldn't know it yourself so you telling her that you are not is not sufficient evidence.

After your doctor has investigated your husband's record and confirmed what you are telling her I would tell her that you don't think you are bipolar. Your doctor sounds inquisitive and I think she will listen to you.

Hi, thanks for your response. I haven't taken my anti depressants this morning and I feel I'm thinking clearer. It was my decision to ask for an anti depressant. It wasn't given to me because I was erratic or anything like that. And I've been on them for about 3 months, but just had it increased on my request and that is where I believe it may have been too high. And after 3 months, if I was bipolar don't you think I would be in full blown mania right now, even if I discontinued them at this point.

I'm not the one who had the breakdown. I just went in there and thought maybe an antidepressant can help me to get through the crap in the marriage. A friend actually gave me that advice. I thought why not try it. I think maybe the dosage was too high.

Anyways, I agree and am relieved that she is going to finally get to the bottom of my husband's treatment and this may well settle my mind as to what did happen with husband regarding this breakdown because the mystery of it, cause of privacy issues is what is making me stressed. Husband has major trust issues, I think relating to his illness, so I don't think I've been told why he was acting the way he was truthfully or fully. Her (pdoc) being able to access them to settle this once and for all for me will be my biggest help. I guess she sees this and feels the only way for her to properly diagnose me, in her mind and relieve the obvious tension in me is for her to see his file. So, if anything I am going to continue to go back and see her until she can give me that information. It's probably the only way I will ever get the whole truth on husband's treatment and peace of mind.. Which is what is causing me to seek help in the first place. Not mania or anything else like that.

I would be careful just going off of your antidepressants so quickly... they should be reduced slowly or you may have a reaction to going off of them.. I would ask my pharmacist how to withdraw from them.. I to would think of going to another pdoc.. once faith is broken with a doctor that basically looks in to your heart and soul it's hard I find to get it back.. you need to work with someone you trust and are comfortable with.. although I agree that if she is looking into all possibilities that's a good thing..x

I hate not being trusted, especially from your Pdoc or Tdoc. I find that if you continue with the same doctor the truth will eventually come out.

Two years ago my doctors tried to get me to go on disability, I refused because I didn't know if I had enough paperwork and needed more money to pay off some bills.

Then I suffered an awful two years, I am now on disability trying to get me some SSDI money and the doctors treat me real good because they know I really tried to give it the old Collage try. Their answers on any of my paperwork really shows it.

I also found that what or how I describe something in my life is different than how they describe it or word it. Over time they finally figured out what I meant and they wrote it in my file.

I used to tell my Pdoc how I felt that my soul was damaged, now I just say my intrusive thoughts are on overload.106

I was asked a question by an individual whowas asking about Meds. I have omitted his/her name and will do so for anyone who asks me a question. I posted this in my journal, because I think I overdid the amount of information I gave, and felt that others could learn some stuff about what their taking.

Exclusively the new EMSAM drug that has come out this past year. Very few people have experiance with this drug, and doctors will be reluctant to use the drug do to the class of drugs it belongs in. However, this reluctance should, and will be slowly overcome because of its unique approach that reduces the risks associated with other drugs of its type. I have included a LARGE amount of information about all sorts of drugs, and I hope it inspires people to learn more about what there taking and ask maybe get them to ask questions to your doctor about what your drugs do.

Not that type of drug, though I have more then enough information and experiance on the short term and long term implications of this disease.

The truth is, for paranoia, and anxiety... Marijuana works great for around 5-6 years, then it turns against you and you find yourself in dire straights. I tell you its not a good place to be in. The medication perscribed by the doctor does NOT have this time period. It keeps working for many many months. The only thing is, that finding the right med is hard and long. You want to experiment, constantly... take notes... and keep triing new ones... there is allot to try, and sometimes a single drug can eliminate an entire class of drugs for you. This will shorten the time period for it.

Its not an easy process. After 12 years of this, I can say that I am as stable as any &quot;Normal&quot; person. Finally.107

I also take kelp and saw palmetto, but that is more for my gall bladder and hormones. i have considered starting to take rhodiola.....definitely something to think on.

however, i think that removing things like processed foods, un-needed chemicals, etc is what helps the best. at least in my experience. i have felt much better removing than i have adding.

I will try that Alive stuff Fibrolizzy and des, you are correct about all the processed stuff. Really the best thing is vitamin intake at the correct levels and fresh food should help but I am so not the type to get into that routine..... I try, I really do, lol. But since finding out about the fibro, I will try harder.109

Does anyone here feel like a prescription junkie?
My drugs no longer work for my condition (BIPOLAR) I am on Prozac 20mg for deppression and Semi-sodium Valporate250mg for my mania. It was ok for a few months but now is not balancing out anymore. i am more depressed than happy and I would rather have the manic side again.
I now have to see my doctor on 25th January and I want to go on topirimate(TOPAMAX) it would stop the headaches and it is used as a mood stabiliser although not licenced for Bipolar in the UK.
I have tried all kinds of medication for my sleepless nights Zopiclone, Tripramine and also tablets for constipation caused by all these.

My daughter is BP and is taking zyprexa and Topamax, and just saw a neurologist, for what seemed like seizures, but ndoc thinks are a form of migraine. He was going to prescribe Topamax, when he saw she was already on it. Killing 2 birds with one stone!
Im guessing semisodium Valporate is some form of Depakote... perhaps Tegretol might work as a mood stabilizer.

Christine I know what you mean. Depression has become an epidemic. I think our brains are messed up because our brains are the same as our cave-dwelling ancestors but the society we now live in is so far removed from what our brains were 'designed' for. We live in an environment where we are fed with an endless stream of entertainment, computer games, muic wherever we go (ipods) our brains can't cope with this endless stimulation. this over-stimulation also makes it harder to cope with boredom because it is like a drug - we need to be entertained all the time. over-stimulation also makes it harder to sleep properly and deeply. Plus we are bombarded with images of perfect celebs leading 'perfect' lifestyles. A combination of over-stimulation and disatisfaction and less good sleep. Disaster!

Hi Chris...
My brother swears he is an indigo child. When he isnt a Wiccan. or a super Christian, or a Pagan.

I also think that in countries where they dont have these meds, life is different. They arent exposed to our fast pace, the same stresses, the stuff in our food, all sorts of things. Also, they may use indigenous herbs, etc., or alcohol. Or may send the ill off away from society.

lilmargie 8 years ago
Erin, that's a decision only you can make. Your profile does not say anything about how old you are or where you are at in your life and you have to take all of that into consideration.

The drugs are expensive. They do not cure MS, they only slow down its progression by reducing the number of attacks that you have. The younger you are when you have your attacks, the longer your disease has to work on you and do more damage.

I had my first discernable attack in 1998. I did not have anything else happen again until 2005. That is a very common story with everybody here. Don't delude yourself into thinking it has gone away or that you have a &quot;light&quot; case of it. It's a SNEAKY BASTARD OF A DISEASE.

I now have a permanent limp, I have fallen a couple of times and broken two bones on the foot of my affected leg. I just started to use a cane.

Would it be different if I had been dx'd earlier and started on the drugs? Who knows? That's the worst thing about it.

You are doing the right thing by coming here and getting different takes on things. Get yourself educated, make a decision that is right for you.

Best of luck to you.

LilMargie says it best... Only YOU can decide for yourself. I was dx in 1993 and was on betaseron when my number came up in the lottery (yeah, that's how it was done in the beginning of the MS drugs that are now availble; back then, beta was the only game in town). I was on beta over 8 years until it ate the tissue under my skin and left me with a pretty 4&quot; scar on my right thigh... Ugh...

I have been on no drugs for the MS except 1000 IU Vit. D since 2003 when I quit betaseron. Right now, I'm trying to get on Copaxone, but can't afford the co-pays so I'm letting the Universe decide (I'm on the list for programs).

I also focus on FAITH not FEAR with this disease. Yes, I am very much a Polly Anna, but it has served me well with MS which I've had over 14 years... If you have any questions, send me a message! xoxoxo Cj (Cindyjo)

I agree with LilMargie. Much of what this disease does is silent, you show no symptoms, but damage is still being done. It's something you must give a great deal of thought to from all sides.
As LilMargie said, they don't cure, but slow the disease down. I don't like shots, but would hate having to depend on others more. For now it's about the only FDA proven way to really fight back.
Good luck to you friend!

Im in the same boat with you erin. I have never had a symptom of MS but because of the spinal tap and MRI, they diagnosed me with it. So they want to put me on drugs because &quot;early treatment&quot; is a good idea. I havn't started yet but its hard to agree to start taking injections, if I run 6km a day and feel great. Especially when they say the drugs are about 33% effective at slowing the disease. I think only you should decide because you are the one who will have to play the &quot;what if&quot; scenario 10 or 20 years down the road.

When i was first diagnosed I was in denial of course and chose not to take the reccommended drug. I was ok for a couple months after my first relapse and then I got hit real hard. I was a mess for about a year experiencing attack after attack. I was scared of all the listed side effects that I would likely get if I used Rebif. Instead I tried a herbal route with no success. After that tough year I decided I better get with the Rebif. I did and my only regret was not starting it when they told me to.

Hello everyone!
I don't think I am going to my dr anymore. She is a very good Rhuemy but the only advice I get from her is to change my lifestyle and take the drugs to feel better. I have tried most of the drugs she has suggested and they do help a bit but they all have their side effects. None of them make me feel great. The pain is still there it is just a bit duller.
So I guess we all have to make a choice as to taking the meds with their side effects or feeling the effects of the fibro. I had a soft message the other day on my neck and shoulders and I thought I was going to die from the pain. I let her continue thinking that when it was over the area would feel better. No, it didn't. Some of the posts I have read on here say the message feels good. It goes to show you that we are all different and what works for one does not work for all.
Oh well, have a good day!

I'm sorry that you are so frustrated with your situation. The drugs taken for Fibromyalgia (FMS) usually do not totally alleviate pain. They make it more tolerable. A key point to remember is that the longer a chronic pain cycle continues, the harder it becomes to manage or stop. It is important to follow a regimen of some sort even if you don't love the results. When it comes to managing FMS, something is better than nothing. You have to be your own best advocate and keep on looking for other alternatives. Your doctor is correct in that lifestyle changes must be made when managing FMS. Making those changes combined with medication may make a huge difference in your symptoms.

I have had a couple of hot stone massages and found them to be very helpful. The massage part was painful but I felt a lot more comfortable for about 2 days afterwards.

I'd like to recommend that you consider purchasing the book &quot;Fibromyalgia for Dummies.&quot; It contains very good information on how to manage this syndrome. You can purchase it online at Amazon. Knowledge is power.

Good luck to you and take care.

Hi Peg. I'm afraid the reason your doctor is telling you that is because that IS our only answer. There is no cure. I told my doctor I was hoping for the magic pill that was going to make we well again. She basically told me to suck it up... this is a chronic disease, I'm never going to get better, and I need to learn to cope. It was harsh, but true. Bear in mind I've had FM for 30+ years and was on my umpteenth search for a miracle.

So all we CAN do is change our lifestyles, take what meds we can tolerate, and plug on. For me, the only massage that helps is excruciatingly painful deep tissue massage. It hurts at the time, but relaxes the knots in my muscles and prevents spasms for weeks. Light massage, swedish massage, or any of the surface massages that only get the tops of your muscles make my pain worse. There are lots of different types of massage - maybe that particular therapist just wasn't the right one for you. I've been do over a dozen and only two actually helped me. One I saw every two weeks for eight years, she helped so much.

Making the pain duller may be the best we can hope for.

I did the master cleanser diet last year and ALL of my Fibro symptoms went away for 8 months. It recently came back so I started the cleanse again, and I have already (in the first 2 days) feel relief...

I believe Fibromyalgia is our body's way of telling us we are full of toxins. The cleanse has helped so many people. I highly recommend it.

The book costs $6-$7 it's called The Master Cleanser by Stanley Burroughs.

So heartshine, I hope this doesn't sound snarky, but are you getting a percentage of book sales for master cleanse? Your posts have all been about that curing your Fibro. It's just a little hard for me to believe that someone's fibro can be &quot;cured&quot; by cleansing.

Thank you all for your advice. I am going to go out this week-end and buy both of the books recommended. Your right, knowledge is power and I need to read about this ugly illness that is chronic and will be with me forever. I also believe in Cleanses so I am going to try the one heartshin recommended and see how that helps. I do believe we all have plenty of toxins so if this will help I'm all for it.
Thank you again and I hope you all feel better.114

Cancer trial could help so many women
Mar 10 2008 by Jane Picken, Evening Chronicle

Scientists in Newcastle are starting the first UK trial of a drug which could beat breast and ovarian cancer. Health Reporter JANE PICKEN investigates

WOMEN with advanced forms of breast and ovarian cancer, and who also have a particular gene fault which makes them susceptible to the disease, will be asked to take part in groundbreaking work.

Experts at Newcastle University want to trial a new drug which works by knocking out key DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells.

It does this by blocking the action of an important enzyme involved in DNA repair, known as PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) and is part of a class of potent anti-cancer drugs known as PARP inhibitors.

The research, which is due to be carried out over 18 months, will be lead by Dr Ruth Plummer, who is based at the Northern Centre for Cancer Treatment, in Newcastle General Hospital. It is being funded by Cancer Research UK.

People who inherit faults in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 50-80% chance of developing cancer, senior lecturer Dr Plummer said.

Currently women with hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer are treated in the same way as every other woman who develops the disease.

We hope this trial will show that by using the PARP inhibitor we can offer them more targeted treatment.

Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are responsible for around 5% of the 44,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in the UK and for more than 5% of the 6,615 cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed each year.

The Newcastle team believe their research could offer hope for the future by paving the way for the drug to be used as a preventative treatment.

We may be able to use the PARP inhibitor to offer protection to women who inherit these genetic faults, continued Dr Plummer.

We may be able to use it to mop up stray cancer cells before they actually develop into tumours, sparing the need for preventative surgery.

Throughout our lifetime we accumulate small amounts of damage to our DNA. This can occur naturally as cells work, divide or age.

Normal cells have two DNA strand-break repair mechanisms to patch up this damage or correct mistakes which may occur during replication.

People who inherit faults in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes only have one DNA strand-break repair mechanism to help fix damage to their cells. This means they have a higher risk of developing cancer.

But it also means these inherited forms of cancer have an Achilles heel and a drug which can disable the only remaining DNA strand-break repair mechanism should also kill the cancer cell.

The start of this clinical trial is a very exciting development and we look forward to seeing the results, said Prof Herbie Newell, Cancer Research UKs executive director of clinical and translational research.

The development of 'personalised treatment' tailored to the requirements of an individual patient is becoming a reality and offers the opportunity to design new drugs that are truly selective for different forms of cancer.

Energy company manager Emma Duncan may not be taking part in the trial, but she could benefit from its findings in the future.

The 33-year-old. from Cramlington, Northumberland, carries the BRCA1 danger gene and was first diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in June 2003.

When Emma was just nine years old her mother Irene Gibson had died from breast cancer, aged just 32.

Emmas grandmother was 42 when she lost her life to the disease.

She was then diagnosed with cancer in her right breast in June 2005.

I believe that any new and specific treatment which will target inherited forms of cancer is good news, said Emma, who had a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery.

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer my consultant explained that I would get the same treatment as women who dont carry the genetic fault.

This research means there could be options for me in the future. If the worst comes to the worst and I need more treatment, at least Ill know there may be something else available.

My mum died from advanced breast cancer. If this treatment had been around when she was ill, she might have benefited from it.

With cancer always at the forefront of Emmas mind, she has become a committed supporter of Cancer Research UK.

Without research and fundraising that supports it, I may not have had the opportunity to be successfully treated, Emma added.

i just started taking it on Saturday and haven't had any appetite since...today i didn't eat anything, and didn't want to eat--unusual for me since i usually self-medicate with food. changes in appetite and mood changes are listed as symptoms of toxicity...how long do they have to persist before i should talk to the doctor? i know some side effects go away with time.

i hear that with most of the ED drugs there are significant drawbacks that most men go through, most importantly is that they "feel like crap." i don't know if it's worth it, i wouldn't want my partner to go through that. is there anything that has a more hollistic approach?

That's why I joined this group, but never got any suggestions here. I've recently started using Stimulin. I'll let you know if it helps.

Just posted this on another thread and it seems worth posting here too.

We did not try any drugs when my husband began to lose his erections. We tried a few of the natural gimmick products and although they did do something for him - it wasn't much :)

We sought the help of a holistic doctor as we knew a lack of blood flow could be related to diabetes or heart issues and he directed us to an interesting website.
www.SayNoToED.com this stuff is working considerably better than anything else we have tried.

Hope this helps

I tried the Stimulin for just over 2 weeks. After feeling the low blood pressure symptoms for a few days due to the vaso-dialation, still no improvement. So I quit taking them and the search continues.122

Ok terrible confession to make.
Up until i was 3 months pregnant i still didnt know if i wanted to keep the baby, and ill admit i think on 4 seperate occasions i have had a few binges with my friends to sort of block the thought of being pregnant.
The last time was about 2 months ago and since then i just cant it out of my head. I have heard the babies heart several times since this and seen her on the scan and everythign looks fine, and surely if there was a problem the midwife would say?

But im so scared that i have hurt my baby daughter in someway, im terrified by my own stupidity and selfishness i may of caused long term damage....

i know many people may judge me when reading this and i know i have no excuse, but i didnt know whether i wanted the baby, ant had been sent to jail, my mum and dad live so far away and i didnt feel like i could talk to anyone, having a few lines of cocaine or bomb of speed made me numb to the feelings.
I just feel so ashamed but i needed to ask opinions because i dont feel like i can tell my midwife i just know what she will think of me!

At least you are able to admit your mistakes which doesnt make it right but no one has the right to judge you we all make mistakes and many we wish we could take back however the past is the past and we cant chnge that the only thing we can control is our futures and I hope you baby is fine but only time will tell because sometimes babies can be born addictted which I dont think will happen in this case but just remember you are strong to admit you where wrong and that is all that matters. God~Bless and Good~Luck!

Honestly.. I think that stopping when yuo did is better than still doing it. i think beating yourself up about it for the rest of the pregnancy will do more damage than good. From the things that i have read use of these substances can inhibit fetal growth for one.. cause miscarriages for another. there are alot of issues.. you are what about 5 months along now? I would think that any issues would be able to be seen by now, however i am not a dr. In my opinion, I would care less about what my midwife thought about my previous use and be more concerned about the effects on the baby. I dont think there is room for judgement when you come here or to a dr. In my opinion, you are looking for help and that is what matters. Please do the right thing by your child and talk with your midwife or dr. Let us know how it goes. Good Luck and God Bless.

I think the main thing is that you have stopped and that you are now being as healthy as you can be for the baby. Sounds like you were going through a difficult time and have alot of stress in your life. You realized that you had to make a change and you did. You are human and made a mistake that you feel guilty about. If everything with your baby has been good so far that's a good sign. You probably won't know if there is any damage until the baby is born or once he/she is developing. I hope you realize how courageous you are for admitting this and I really admire you for stopping any drug use for your health and your baby's health. My advice is to forgive yourself and be as healthy as you can the rest of your pregnancy, best of luck!

maybe that post made me sound a little worse than it was!
i am NOT a regular drug user, i used to enjoy the odd small amount recreationally but no where near enough to be addicted and usually weeks apart.
i think i was in shock that i was ging to have to grow up becoming a mum and was desperatly trying to keep hold of my partying days with my friends.
i know now it was stupid and i intend to make it up to my daughter for the rest of her life by being the best strongest mum she could ever ask for.
thank you for ur support, you make me feel less on my own than i thought i was. these are things i could never talk to my family about. your all angels in disguise xx

I think you need to tell your midwife about what happened so incase there is further tests that should be done. Even if you feel guilty and no matter wat she feels, it doesnt matter, its for the safety and health of your own little girl. Hope there is no serious damage. And I am glad you quit when you did.
And from your last post, in my opinion no matter if you do it once a year or everyday, you are still an addict, other wise why would you keep using. But im glad you were able to give it up, for a lot of people its just not so easy.
Hope all is well. Take care.

It doesn't matter what the midwife will think of you. You know you made a mistake and know you realize that you have to think about your baby. Tell the midwife about your drug use. The doctors ask about any drug or alcohol use for a reason, they need to know your history.

There is nothing you can do about the past, but you can do plenty about the present and the future.

At your next appointment think only about the baby and tell your midwife.

You should be proud of yourself for admitting what you did, and also for caring about what happens to your little one.

You are not the first mom to have made a mistake, and remember you won't be the last. The important thing is to learn from them and to try not to make the same mistake twice.

Good Luck, and don't beat yourself up about this, but again, do tell your midwife/doctor.

Hugs,123

after suffering severe anxiety from early teens until it became disabling last November, I just wanted to let others know about a drug that has helped me so much I wanted to share.

I was on beta-blockers, valum, sleeping medications and every herbal remedy I coud find but it still prevented me from working & leaving the house so my doctor refered me to a psychiatrist. I've been put on Effexor (venaflaxine) 375mg (increased slowly from 75mg) and find it amazing. It is a drug for panic disorder and I have no side effects whatsoever and I am so cslm, confident and find going out exciting rather than daunting. I still have bad days but they don't spiral as bad as they used to.

hope this is of help,

Concerta does nothing for me, ritalin wasn't bad, but now my daughter is on a new one called Focalin, but you know what I have enough with my pain killer addiction to even think of another problem. But I'm sure I'll be letting you know what I think of them, but no I am not addicted to stimulants only pain killers to the point that I used to do c oke and I don't even care for that anymore.

I don't know if anyone is interested but my Abnormal Psych. Professor sent me this about inhaling and I found it insteresting prolly for the fact that I do it...

It's a class II substance, which means it's in the same category as morphine. The problem with snorting is that it's highly unpredictable. It can make you angry, irritable, euphoric, anxious, and many other things. Ya just don't know what you're going to get. It's almost identical to snorting cocaine. Sigmund Freud once thought that cocaine was the PERFECT drug. He took it himself. He, then, started prescribing it to his patients. What he found was that it had terrible side effects. Made people more depressed, more anxious, more angry, over time. This is a fact. That's why cocaine addicts report awful depression and unstable mood states. Even if you don't suffer from depression, snorting Ritalin is a good way to get there. If you do suffer from depression, then it will make it worse (over time). Then, you'll start believing that Ritalin is the only way you'll be able to feel better. Ugh. It's a dark dark cycle that seduces its victims by, initially, making them feel better. Then... the bad stuff starts creeping in. Then there are a list of health problems that can come from engaging in snorting Ritalin.

There's a famous study that was done on mice. The mice were given a choice between a spigot that gave them water, and a spigot that gave them cocaine. The finding was fascinating. The mice never drank the water. They only took the cocaine. Even though they were dying of thirst, they still chose the cocaine... until they died from dehydration. Now that's a powerful drug. The same neuro-chemical actions are taking place when a person snorts Ritalin. The Ritalin and cocaine are hitting a primitive part of the brain that can actually override other basic urges and needs. It can even start to change your thinking in weird ways....

I have never snorted anything except for coke. To tell ya the truth I prefer the stimuant Focalin-XR. It is supposed to be more purer than ritalin, concerta etc. I perfer pain pills to anythng else. Percs, Fentany that's my drugs of choice, but Focalix-XR is probably the best stimulant for me. I am starting to use it more and more one a day mostly occasionally one in the afternoon, but that is only once in awhile. My son is on stratera, but that is a non-stimulant, I have never tried it, but it seems to be a dud. It doesn't seem to do anything for my son. He is going back in a few weeks for a medicatin change.

has anyone experienced changes in appetite while taking depakote?

i just started taking it on Saturday and haven't had any appetite since...today i didn't eat anything, and didn't want to eat--unusual for me since i usually self-medicate with food. changes in appetite and mood changes are listed as symptoms of toxicity...how long do they have to persist before i should talk to the doctor? i know some side effects go away with time.

i get nervous about taking medication in the first place because i always wonder if they'll end up doing more harm than good...and my sister has had poor liver function when she was on this medication. help?!

Depakote made me drowsy,, mush brained, and tremors. But no loss of appetite. Trazadone made me lose my appetite. I lost 30 lbs while on it. The effect lasted awhile even after I stopped the drug. So, if you want to lose weight keep taking it. But, I was driven partially crazy by the side effect because I WANTED to enjoy my food. Definetly talk to the pdoc as soon as possible. peace, t

Post:
So I gave up drinking in April, had a few relapses but now have 56 days of sobriety. Personally I question whether I am really an alcoholic or if my out of control drinking was a result of feeling so fucked in my marriage and a feeling of loss of control and helplessness? Regardless, I feel better and healthier as a result.

I bring this up because I know I started drinking more when I realized I was sexually abused. I would think it natural for any of us to abuse alc or drugs to numb the pain. And yes, as I read in another post, alcohol helps with having sex.

My wife continues to drink, in fact in my opinion too much, but she is fully functioning. Yet maybe the amount she drinks is tied to her abuse and infidelity and lies, with the conflict she must carry inside. Maybe she carries none.

So when I was drinking, I never had a clear enough head to really let this all soak in about CSA and the topics that are shared in this forum. And that was a comfortable place for me. It prevented me from taking on more than I really wanted to deal with. Now with a totally clear head I guess I am really dialing in to what I am reading, I am questioning shrinks and whether they are really qualified to help us if there experience is just from schooling and the number of clients they have seen with CSA. How could they otherwise really help us if they don't know what they go through? IMO, they can't, they just advise based on what they have heard and learned.

So I guess this is a poll, how many of you think you drink or drug (prescription or other) excessively to numb the pain and maybe are prevented to let this all hit really deep, and I do not mean that in a bad way, or imply that if you drink or drug that you are not experiencing the hurt. In fact, I would guess I would tip the scales statistically in the forum of those who drank way to much yet had no trouble grasping so much of all of this and still feeling such pain, I am just saying that for some reason I am grasping this in a different way and have nothing to compare it to other than maybe it is because I am not drinking. Not sure how much sense that made but hopefully it was clear enough.

I am going to post a poll in the Alcoholic forum to see how many know of CSA that they experienced. There must be a tie in I am just guessing, it feels correct. In AA meetings we can't take polls, we can only share our own issues as it relates to alcohol and drugs.

Any thoughts?

I don&#039;t know why but I started drinking before I even really remembered any of the details of the abuse. I always knew in a way but memories were gone. I had a 3 month sobriety 3 years ago and that is when I really started feeling fucked up mentally. I started drinking again and was at a chaotic calm for the past 3 years. It&#039;s been 7 days now since I have drank...I have never gone this long before...and I am feeling angry more, not from withdrawals because my nightly dose of valliums is helping with that. I have almost completely stopped thinking about the abuse, or the abuse of my kids (the triggers are scary and sent me off the wall). I feel like now I am more in survival mode than I have ever been. I dissociate a lot so I don&#039;t know. I am the only one in my family who was molested but the rest of my siblings were emotionally and physically abused at times too...me and my brother were the only ones who drank. My sister is the perfectionist and now is on antidepressants and a personality disorder is taking over. I don&#039;t know where I am going with this now.

It was a comment and I am glad you hit send. I too feel fucked up with my sobriety since I am not able to hide from my shit. I am not able to use the high to feel giddy and carefree, like my wife can, and that pisses me off. But for me I know for now I need to keep not drinking. But it does suck. I am angry more often but I think this is normal because I have a lot to be angry about and with the booze I allowed those feelings to be pent up. So I know feeling them sucks but it is good to do (for me). Thank you for your share.

Whodathunk, I&#039;m wondering how the sobriety is going?

My dad was a drunk all my life. One of my brothers also became an alcoholic. The rest of the siblings all felt like my dad was a huge example of what not to do. We all have a fear of being trapped by an addiction.

What I&#039;ve done in the past is eat. Food because a similar comfort as what you describe. Lots of food allowed me not to feel as much pain. It helped to deaden the feelings. I&#039;ve done this thing all my adult life where I use sex to feel good, then use food. I get heavy and have managed to lose the weight by making sex a priority again. And then over again. Back in the &#039;80s when cocaine was a fad in the suburbs I used that to avoid feelings. Fortunately for me I didn&#039;t make enough money to become addicted.

I guess everyone of us have our own maladaptive coping going on to some extent. I&#039;m wondering how the pole in the alcholism board went?

Sobriety is going well. 67 days today, went to an AA meeting last night. AA now for me is as much a social gathering as well as a necessary part of me staying sober. In a way it is the opposite of the experience that abuse left me which was a lack of trust in people, with AA everyone is all honest about what they are going through. A lady last night had relapsed the day before. She was crushed to be back and openly emotional. Others shared that when they relapsed they had to come back the next day and how bad it sucked. When I relapsed the last time it truly was the worst day right up there with finding out about my W&#039;s affair. I was crying in the meetings the day after my relapse, I felt like such a loser.

So I think that this is really helping me with a part of getting past or comfortable with where I am with the abuse, and sex, and everything. I too have added food to my comfort agenda. I also am giving myself a break in that feeling good is a new thing for me and eating for pleasure is just that. I will trade a few pounds for the lift in my self esteem in conjunction with my sobriety.

Being sober does a not of things including not allowing me to hide, hide from intimacy, hide from my being self conscious about sex, hide from the reality of life.

I used to do that...drugs, alcohol, sex, anything to quiet the storms in my brain. I&#039;ve been totally drug and alcohol free for decades now.

But the emotional storms are still there, that hasn&#039;t changed. I guess I&#039;ve just become more experienced in coping with them. Exercise seems to help, so long as I don&#039;t overdo it. I guess I&#039;m more of a workaholic now, I have to be busy with something all the time or I get very weird.

I was always afraid of becoming an alcoholic or drug abuser so I never did either. I smoked some pot when I was younger and older for that matter, just for a little high with friends and silliness. Got drunk with my husbands and would have wild sex with the seconde one. But other than that I did not become addictied to anything, scared me too much. My father is an alcoholic and I didn&#039;t want to be like him. I used sex for everything, feeling go, getting attention, getting away from everything.

I consider myself an alcoholic. I have not had a drink for nearly 26 years. I believe I drank for basically the same reaons non-alcoholics drink. After a hard day in the office I would want to have a beer or two with the guys after work. They would go home after a couple and i would close up the bar at 2:00 AM.

I very seldom woke up in the morning and decided that after work that day I would get so drunk I would soil my own clothing, but I did. However non alcoholics would stop after one or two drinks. I never could. Alcohol affected me differently than it does 90 percent of the drinkers.

I have worked with many others who have a desire to stop drinking While at AA meetings, sexual abuse as children seldom is a topic, but based on my experience in helping other individuals, outside the meeting rooms, I would guess that nearly every one was abused in some way as children, and almost all women were sexually abused.

Dr. Gabor Mate has a series of videos on You Tube. He claims to have treated thousands of women drug addicts and they were all abused as children and never got the emotional nuturing they needed to recover from their abuse.127

So I've always been judgmental about people who smoke weed, drink and do drugs but never had a good reason for it. I've also been very religious about taking my meds everyday.

One of my best friends was dying for me to do it with him, so (with reluctance) I did. And it was nothing special. Then I tried dxm and my body reacted to it. I was shaking and dizzy and felt sick. My friend thought I was going to die and it was all very scary. It was because my BP medications weren't compatible with it. He said that if I was going to continue this stuff, I had to stop taking my meds.

Now my other friends are pulling away from me in disapproval. My mom is noticing me skipping doses. I feel like a mess.
But now I can go to more parties, connect with more people and the more I do, the less I judge. I'm also dealing with BP in a different way.

It might seem like an easy decision, but it's not...

A. Stop the BP meds and continuing smoking, drinking and experimenting or
B. Take the BP meds and stop all other chemical consumptions?

Has anyone else been here and can tell me their experiences?
I'm so lost.

Your medicine is so important, if it wasn't, the doctor wouldn't subject you to it. Are parties and approval really as important as your mental state of mind? If you have to do drugs and drink with these people in order to connect with them, they're not real friends. Trust me. A friend will accept you the way YOU are- with medication. Don't change you and your behavior for others. It won't work in the end, even if it's working now. I wish you the best :)

bad. I've already been through this. I did drugs for the better part of the past 3 years. The last half of high school and my first year at college. I screwed up EVERYTHING. I ended up on coke near the end of it, I'm still blowing blood unfortunately. You may think that won't happen to you, but I'm telling you, with mental disorders (especially if you aren't even taking your meds!) you just lose control more easily. I dropped all my classes and was high every day. I pushed my whole family away and almost got kicked out of my house for smoking in my walk-in closet with my &quot;friends&quot;. What you should do is think about what your good at/what you love. I guarantee you will be able to find something. If you can't, talk to the school college counselor, or to your therapist and talk about your interests. Then make small goals and work on meeting them. Every time you do, your self esteem goes up. I thought I was worthless and I was depressed and didn't give a crap so I just partied and partied, but now that I'm on the other side I realized I would have been wasting my life away. Most of those kids I partied with will end up in rehab possibly even jail. I can tell you for certain, they have no future. I have no problem with people living the way they want to live. But different strokes for different folks, I have bipolar/adhd/gad, and I'm telling you they don't mix with drugs. Plus, you can do better. The world is an amazing place. It's worth seeing and exploring. I might sound crazy to you. Like, you may think it's nothing now, but I'm telling you, things spiral out of control. They have for me more than once.

so my BF is addicted to pot, and he gets really moody when he doesnt have any but lately he has just been so hateful and angry at me. we had a baby nearly 3 weeks ago, and things are really stressful at the moment with the whole adjustment period,and baby doesnt sleep well. but he seems to be smoking more and drinking more, yet still gets so angry and verbally agressive even when he has had some.
i feel like he hates me i cant say anything to him without him saying "fuck you" and if we have an argument(which happens often) he calls me so many names and actually tells me he hates me. if i talk to him about it he says its just anger and he doesnt really mean it, but i cant help but think there must be some truth to it if he says it all the time.
i wonder if it is just the drugs that is making him like this or if he really does resent me, im so confused and hurt because i love him so much, and dont want to turn my back on him. he always seems to be out "getting on" and is spending so much money on it but i cant approach him in any way without him flying off the handle.
but at the same time he says i need to approach the subject differently. i thought i was trying that but i am out of ideas i could yell at him till my throat gave in but i dont think that would help at all. i guess im just at a loss.
so any ideas? has anyone else been having this trouble.
he smoked when we first met but was never this angry he was always a happy kind of pot head.

Pot usually dosen't make you angry and spiteful, maybe it's the booze. Anyways you accepted him as a pot head &amp; boozer before and now your unhappy with your choice.
You should know by now you can't change a person.
You have a baby with the man so now you have 2 choices.
1. Accept him as he is and you change.
2. Tell him you can't stand his drug use and boozing anymore.
It's up to you.

I agree Jen. And when the addicted loved one is a son or daughter, would they have us turn our backs on them, too?

It's really, really easy to be a sidelines coach. What's really, really hard is taking that first step and saying &quot;I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, so I'm reaching out for help.&quot; God bless those who can and do.

This has nothing to do with Satan, and everything to do with dealing with a progressive disease.

Also, for what it's worth, they don't come back as the people we once knew. They can come back as much better people.

It **is** about sons and daughters. And wives, husbands, uncles, aunts and parents and partners, cousins and friends. Everyone is someone's son or daughter.

I used to think I was different from the boyfriends and girlfriends, husbands and wives, of addicted loved ones out there, because my ALO is my son.

I quickly discovered how narrow minded that was. No matter the relationship, we all go through the same experiences and the same feelings.

Seeking OUR OWN recovery is a path that we share. Being mean and judgmental does not support that path. In fact, being judgmental is a huge piece of the problem that brings us here.129

Biogen Idec is committed to supporting you in your journey with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Thats why were excited to announce the FDA approval of PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a), the interferon beta you take once every 14 days.

Thanks I just got an email from them and ignored it. I never want to be the first to try a medication but I will keep my eyes on it.

Hearing about any new drug reminds me of hearing about a new model car that is introduced. Just like any new car is just an adaptation of existing technology, so is any new drug for MS an adaptation of existing technology.

Now something that gets my attention is a new car that is a cure-all for all of the flaws found in existing technology. Something like the hydrogen fuel cell cars. Something that would get my attention with MS would be a CURE. Yeah, that would get my attention alright.

Shepherd Man- I agree I would like something with the name CURE to come out. Excerpt if it would come out now I would lose my retirement &amp; SSI. However if I passed this horrible disease on to my kids, I would love for a cure to be found.

That's the biggest reason I'd like to see a cure Chrissy, so my kids and grandkids never deal with MS. I fear that as long as there is money to be made from treatments, there won't be a cure. Ah, the world we live in. Gotta love it!

I read the email they sent me. You take one shot every 14 days. Sounds great till you get to the side effects. It can kill your liver, you do routine liver check. So, after it harms my liver the test will tell me. It has quite a few more serious effects including death. I'm going to let this one pass me by.

I have been off of my injections for 15 months and on the Paleo diet. I feel so much better than I did on the drugs! I'll take my chances on food instead of Big Pharma.

Gentle hugs, Linda

Someone told me recently about &quot;a friend&quot; who is doing great, better walking, etc., from a new MS drug. I wonder if this is it although my goal in life is to overcome this thing like Terry Wahls, MD has done.
