Post:
This past weekend, I had a really nice gathering with my two sisters and my two sister in laws. One sister missed most of this, in fact all of it, but the rest were there for the whole night into 3 am hot tubbing. It was great fun and of course there were some serious moments.

In the beginning of the night, before the alcohol and hot tub took over, everyone talked about and caught up on their adult children. Everyone asked each other about their kids and commented. It was very light... but of course to me and my scab it was glaringly apparent that not one asked about MY kids. I notice that more than ever now..... how people just don't ask.

After quite a while, I just jumped in and said... "I still have no contact with ED27 but it's ok to ask me about her. I may have absolutely nothing to tell you, but it actually hurts more that no one brings it up than if they do.... YOU are my family.... Maybe you think its too painful to discuss?" My sister, who knows the ins and outs said "There was a time when it WAS too painful for you to talk about...". I agreed and told them that I am at the point now where it doesn't hurt to talk about it, but rather it hurts more that it is ignored." I compared it to a death that no one talks about for fear of creating pain. I stated "The pain is always there.... you cant make it worse by bringing up her name, but ignoring it does" Everyone seemed to understand, nod and of course a dead silence followed. Pour the drinks girls.

The night went on and there were laughs and again serious moments. Hey, we are women... I believe we have the ability to talk things out. At some point, the discussion lead me again to ED27. I admit that I usually talk about her more when I've been drinking and some of the walls are down. As soon as I did, the group again became silent. That sucked. Maybe its too heavy? Probably, but its MY reality and they are my family..... where are they?

I mostly assume its because they just don't understand. Or, they don't realize they can understand if they relate it to something else in their lives. I don't know. All I know is that I was left feeling very empty within the group of my female family members.

I remember having the same feeling when everyone in my family was at my house and I took a moment to explain how they would be getting invites to ED18's graduation party at her Dad's house, but that I would not be there. (For those who don't know me, that is a whole other story that has been done on here). I explained to them all that they had my blessings in going and to not feel uncomfortable, but to just be there to support my daughter. They all had sympathetic looks, but no one said nothing.... not a thing.

Maybe I'm too much of a sharing person. Maybe I believe too much that things on the table are better than an elephant in the room, but I can honestly say that both situation and over all reactions (or non reactions) of my own family have been hard. I don't blame them... what would I do if I didn't know?

I honestly believe there are so many similarities to there being a death of a child. Not the same and I wont try and say it is because I have not been there, but part of the reaction or non reaction of others seems to be so similar. The loneliness of the lack of understanding seems so similar. I have always wanted to talk to my SO's parents about this, as they lost their daughter 20 years ago to an accident, but to this day I cant find a Segway to the subject and I know that if I did, I would barely be able to talk as all the REAL pain would come to the surface, knowing that THEY would understand.

Anyway, just a reminder of what I have been dealt and the loneliness that can do along with it. I'm fine.... I have support.... but there just always seems to be something missing if that makes sense?

I completely understand... I experience the same reactions with my family members, especially the ones who have relationships with my ED as well as me... I am very up front with them and they react as yours did, uncomfortable silence.... It&#039;s like.... umm ... is this a disease they might catch.... I know I surprise them because I am so matter of fact, surprised that I don&#039;t wear the blanket of shame...
I do know, we are alone in this ( save for the people here who share our path).... I find even the people with good intentions, just do not get it... In a way, I hope they never do, if going through this is the only way to gain understanding, better they never understand. I would not wish this hard road on anyone...
And yes, there always seems to be something missing...you make total sense..

I am gonna disagree here (isn&#039;t that a surprise LOL)...

I of course experience the same especially with family (like my own mother especially) I have put much thought and lots of research into this so here goes

THEY GET IT...GRIEF IS GRIEF...AND THEY COULD SHARE YOUR BURDEN WITH YOU EVEN IF THEY DONT UNDERSTAND ALL THE INS AND OUTS

THEY DONT WANT TO...you see our reality with estrangement rocks their phony little everybody&#039;s happy family world...we represent as murrsma said...like we have a disease that might blur their vision of happy happy...we represent a reality that they are not prepared to deal with so they let us grieve alone. You see everyone understands death it happens in even good families and it happens to everyone sooner or later...this kind of death...estrangement...is ongoing today and it is different and no one likes different so they go silent when we bring it up...they hope we will not talk about it cause it really really really makes them uncomfortable...so uncomfortable that they dont even care how sad we are...how much we need to talk about it or get asked about it...THEY JUST WANT US TO SHUT UP AND FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE...TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE...BUT ESTRANGEMENT AND OUR SADNESS.

So I come here and we all talk to each other cause we have seen the perfect storm and the destruction it causes and we walk in reality now !!!!!!!!!!!

Blessing to us all

I agree murrsma..... no one, and I mean no one seems to get it in my world beyond here. I think that AllK could be right too, that they don&#039;t want to see our reality because it&#039;s scary. I just don&#039;t really know the answer because no one is willing to say!

I just know that for myself, if someone was talking to me about something I couldn&#039;t relate to, but that was clearly important, the very least I would do is ask questions to try and understand. As far as I have found, NO ONE is willing to even ask and I find that very very sad indeed.

I agree ALL - NOBODY wants to talk about it - it makes everything so unpleasant - untidy really. Who wants to think that their relationship with their offspring can evaporate one day - never to return?

ITT - do you REALLY want to talk about your EDs with anyone who doesn&#039;t want to? Why bother? Especially when you have a group of people who are expressly here just for that purpose. We may not be able to get in the hottub with a cocktail, but we understand...because we&#039;ve been there.

Now - as a &quot;cyber friend&quot; - I beg you - PLEASE do not bring up the subject of the dead daughter with the SO&#039;s parents. It will NOT be a good thing - And if you want dead silence, THAT might be a surefire way to bring it on.

The other night, I found out that our neighbor&#039;s son had killed himself - we had known this kid since he was born - He was a nice kid - only 25 years old - just had a birthday about a week ago. I was devastated - it was as if our daughter had died all over again. If people bring up the death of our daughter (most do not), it feels as if they have stuck a stiletto straight into my heart over and over again. The pain is just that brutal.

Assuage your pain another way - talk to a therapist, write or even rant on PWWA, start a blog, start a support group in your own community. ANYTHING else. There is no segway into a conversation such as that one. And they will NOT understand - they will not empathize. It will only hurt them.

No matter how much YOU equivocate your estrangement with a death of a child - it is NOT and will NEVER be the same thing - I know this because I have experienced both - at the same time. They are not even in the same stratosphere.

Estranged parents are in a special group - We have gone through experiences other people (like your sisters) have not - Parents of deceased children are in another group - and while the two groups are similar - they can never be the same.

I find when I am talking about something I consider to be important, people rarely listen. Nobody seems to even know how to listen anymore - they are far too self absorbed - and far too worried about what they want to say to be concentrating on what is being said.

But here at PWWA we are here for you - so tell us how you feel anytime - we&#039;ll listen because we know just how it can be.

Take Care

Allk... Yes we have seen, lived and survived the perfect storm.... And yes, I agree, we rock to the core the Hallmark picture of what is &quot;seen&quot; as perfect... I also believe that our strength and ability to pick ourselves up and proudly move forward with our lives disturbs some people... We are viewed as aberrations by many...... We make them uncomfortable....
Intakes two...it is sad...for them. The people here, on this forum, I have found, have huge hearts, have through their own struggles developed compassion, wisdom, strength, empathy, resolve, self worth, depth, honesty....there are no shallow, mundane, selfish, careless, heartless people &quot;here&quot;...... Here we can be open, knowing we will get honest ( even brutally honest) insight and opinions from people who care enough to &quot;listen&quot; .... I&#039;ll take open real and honest over vapid and superficial any day...

I know what you mean ITT when nobody wants to acknowledge the estrangement..I find it either happens because the person involved simply has no point of reference to how you are feeling and it&#039;s easier for them to AVOID the whole subject. They don&#039;t know if they should speak about it and risk upsetting you or talk about it and risk upsetting you. Either way, they are clueless to what is going on with you.
I know that family are SUPPOSED to be supportive and understanding, lmao, yeah just like our EO who we expected to grow up and continue a normal relationship with us, HOWEVER, we all know that just doesn&#039;t happen in every family. Some lucky ones seem to be able to hash things out..and it&#039;s disappointing all over again when the ones we expect to be there for us just aren&#039;t in the way we would like.
You know in my life I have had more kindness from strangers than from the people I expected would be there for me, be it family or friends. I guess it depends on the experiences people have had. Like everyone here, it takes having lived it to get it!
No one I&#039;ve talked to really gets it except you guys on here.
And as Allk said quite rightly, no one wants to catch the Estrangement contagion.

In the beginning, I talked about &quot;it&quot; so much &ndash; while wanting and canvasing everyone &ldquo;on my side&rdquo; found that not all agreed with me. This made me angry and sad and feeling a bit betrayed - because I EXPECTED those who knew me best to &quot;agree&quot; with me.

They didn&#039;t &ndash; which caused me to &ldquo;defend&rdquo; myself causing a strain on those relationships. However, in the end - I figured that &ndash; those who really cared about me - really cared MORE about me - than the estrangement - so - they just don&rsquo;t bring it up anymore and neither do I. I have learned to RESPECT those who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t or didn&rsquo;t get it&rdquo; because this is not something they have ever experienced. AND, truly, my life is not just about estrangement and loss.

I agree about talking to a therapist (if that works for you), writing in a journal or this forum. We seem to know what each other needs &ndash; in an attempt to continue with our lives and be happy.

I feel that those who come to this forum &ndash; are looking for a place and people they can talk/vent to about estrangement and BE accepted and not judged.

Today, I don&rsquo;t really care anymore if people (those close tome) &ndash; who don&rsquo;t know estrangement &ndash; commiserate or ask questions with me anymore &ndash; I guess I really don&rsquo;t want their &quot;unprofessional&quot; opinion.

Support groups are definitely for the &ldquo;like&rdquo; minded.

Take care. Opal

Nope, I don&#039;t want to talk about her with people that don&#039;t want to. It was just made clear to me that they DONT want to. I thought it was because of their fear that it might make me feel pain, but I can see now their reluctance to even bring up her name isn&#039;t at all about or for me! It was an eye opener for sure.

&quot;You know in my life I have had more kindness from strangers than from the people I expected would be there for me, be it family or friends. I guess it depends on the experiences people have had. Like everyone here, it takes having lived it to get it! &quot; VERY well said Violet.

I&#039;m not looking to pour my pain onto people. That is never why I bring her up. I mention her because its my reality and everyone else is talking about their reality so...... guess I have lost that right. I&#039;m at the point with this now where I don&#039;t need to talk about the pain. I&#039;m able to remember and bring up memories that were good or cute from when she was little and it doesn&#039;t hurt. Even if I bring up one of those moments, it will silence a room as if I had a gun in my hand. It is completely bizarre.

I&#039;m not looking to compare my pain to the pain of losing a child to death. What I want to compare is how other people react to the person who has had such a loss. Top, having lost your daughter, if you had mentioned her name and something you remembered about her in the past and everyone suddenly stopped talking for minutes, doesn&#039;t that hurt? Doesn&#039;t it feel like an obvious echo? Doesn&#039;t it glare in your face? What I&#039;m wanting to know is if my SO&#039;s parents have felt the same thing..... the isolation from being able to acknowledge that she even existed because it scares other people into silence. Maybe that doesn&#039;t happen when you lose a child to death because as it was said here, everyone understands death but not everyone can relate to estrangement.

I agree with you all about utilizing a therapist for the dealing with the deep painful feelings. Did that and it was very helpful. I just want to be clear that I&#039;m not talking about trying to get my family to listen to that kind of stuff, nor did I try and talk about the deep pain the other night. All I did was bring up her name and told them they could ask about her and that it was ok. Again, clearly its NOT ok.... to them.

THAT usually doesn&#039;t happen - although I don&#039;t usually bring our deceased daughter up in conversation - unless it is with parents who have lost their children - which believe it or not - there are quite a few we know.

Yes - it is uncomfortable and it is totally unfair - just like it is unfair to see grandparents with their grandkids or hear about their accomplishments when they exercise their bragging rights. It isn&#039;t fair - but for whatever &quot;reason&quot; - It is what it is.1

i used to be a drug addict
it started out as trying to numb my pain and make me feel better
and it did...for alittle bit

then it consumed my life
and made it even worse
i came to hate myself so much
and i got to the point where if i wasn't high or drunk i couldn't even function
and i hated it so much

i quit cold turkey
and i'm not saying it'll make everything better
but it makes everything more bearable2

I wish I had both the contacts and the sheer nerve to use illegal drugs (mostly marijuana) as I'm sure they do a better job of numbing both mental and physical pain. But...at my advanced age, spending time in a holding cell would be much worse than putting up with the pain :)

I wouldn't judge the danger level by narcotic classification or not. I've looked up the side effects of ultram and percocet, and the non-narcotic ultram has worse side effects and worse overdose effects as well (well, more painful, that is).

If you are on methadone I advice you to stop taking other medications like xanax or any others because mixing it with methadone will kill you. I have had many friends die because of that. Just concerned that's all. Kay126

Do not MIX XANAX and METHADONE is causes resipiratory failure. You will be found DEAD soon if you keep that up. Klonapin and Xanax are the same thing; benzodiazpiens. just that one (xanax) is stronger than the other. PLEASE do NOT mix your XANAX and your METHADONE, if not for yourself, do it for everyone that cares about you!!!!

I think we've all seen the ads for drugs on TV - the ones that will help with RA or Psoriasis - or other conditions. After announcing what these drugs will do for you - they give you a litany of the damages these drugs can cause you, often times including cancer or death. The trade-off always strikes me as a bit too severe.

Okay - and I think we've all seen the ads by lawyers on TV for "bad drugs" telling us that certain drugs have caused many problems and diseases - some of those being cancer and death.

We can get these drugs fairly easily by merely obtaining a prescription from a physician.

BUT - I bought some antihistamines, over the counter, at the drug store the other day and i had to sign a special form that is submitted to the government for people who buy antihistamines. Apparently an ingredient in antihistamines is used to make drugs that are dangerous for us.

Shouldn't the government be taking the drugs that are prescribed for us - a bit more seriously? The selective attitude, on the part of the government, is a little confusing and I suppose one has to follow the money to figure this one out. I just find this to be a bit curious.

Yes that ingredient in antihistimines is a big problem here in NZ. People smuggle it through the borders it is called contac NT I think and is used to manufacture what is called P here but might be what you call ice. It is a heinous drug.
We have the same problems here with the govt allowing drugs with terrible side effects. I was given a prescription for a drug for migraines from a specialist and after reading an entire page of possible side effects including basically going insane I declined to take it. I showed it to my GP who agreed with my decision wholeheartedly.

I will make a comment which I know will be not very popular. All drugs have side effects. Some can be really dangerous. But drugs also save lives and improve quality of lives. I would be 3-5 times dead if not for medications I will be having for the rest of my life. As with everything in life education and restrain are the best answers. With my long history of autoimmune problems with peculiar symptoms and strange reactions to medications, I learn to be very careful with drugs, take them when there is no other choice. Sometimes one condition improves another gets worse. I always calculate pros and cons. I had to learn how to live with this risks, but live, not merely to survive the day and try to rest at night. No ammount of government research and regulation is going to solve these problems. We want to have good living, we have to invest our time to get to know important things ourselves. Relaying 100% on other opinions being that doctors, financial advisers etc, who not always have our best interests at heart, is in my opinion big mistake. It exposes us to even bigger risks. I am in favor of using complementary and natural medicine, but when you are seriously il, it will not save your life.

When I&#039;m sick, if they make a pill to make me feel better... I&#039;m taking it. I hate being sick!

You have to watch the all natural supplements too. They are not regulated AT ALL.
At least pharmaceutical medications have some kind of regulatory guidelines.

The benefits of some medications.... for most people.... far far outweigh the slight chance of the possible side effects for a very few.

It&#039;s really no different than getting in your car or in an airplane.... there&#039;s always a slight chance for really bad side effects, but you do it anyway because the odds are completely in your favor.

Like Kutani says.... It&#039;s best to take the time to do your research and make your own decision. One is not necessarily &quot;better&quot; than the other.

I agree natural remedies are better if they in fact do help then that is great. I think when taken as directed prescribed medications are a necessity for many people.

The ingredient found in antihistamines such as Sudafed are used to make meth by drug dealers &amp; other scum that are brewing this drug in their homes and have been doing this for years now....it is very common in our area also. These people go to extreme to make cheap drugs and to mix them with other ingredients such as a white powdery substance, such as Inositol in order to extend their supply ...I found this out while working at GNC, I think it has gone to more extreme than anyone realizes.

What is so frustrating to me is that it makes the process for us to get what we need almost impossible. Have anyone else noticed you cannot find bath salts anymore....these people have started sniffing the stuff to get high, so most places have taken it off of the market......it is a crazy world!!!!!

I can&#039;t speak to all drugs but I know for me, I wouldn&#039;t be here if I didn&#039;t take antidepressants. I have suffered from chronic depression my whole life due to extreme abuse as a child.

Back then (in the dark ages) doctors didn&#039;t believe children could have anxiety or depression. When my hair started falling out they thought I was allergic to our family cat! I didn&#039;t learn until I was an adult about alopecia.
I was so stressed that it caused my hair to fall out and I was only about 8 or 9 years old. Once I married and left my parents home it stopped! I also chewed my nails and cuticles to the point of two nail beds getting so infected I lost two nails. That was in the 7th grade.

If I hadn&#039;t started taking antidepressants I am quite sure I wouldn&#039;t be here to talk about this. So I for one and extremely grateful for the progress medical science has made in this area.

I&#039;m not dissing drugs altogether as I know many of them are absolutely necessary. I do take blood pressure medicine, but some of the others just scare the heck out of me. It makes my anxiety soar through the roof. I am careful with natural supplements as some are just as dangerous as perscription drugs.
I took anti depressants for years and am one of the lucky ones to be able to get off them.
I say that a person has to do what is good for them. Natural has worked for me, but it is not necessarily the remedy for others....and I respect that.

Well actually, you guys, I was pointing out the irony of being able to buy drugs that are known to be deadly to some - and yet we are required to sign off on a government form for an over-the-counter antihistamine.

I realize that some of the contents of the antihistamines are used for making illegal drugs - but I&#039;m not sure that those illegal drugs are anymore dangerous to us than the legal drugs are. Who knows........

It just seems odd to me - that&#039;s all.10

yes some do that. i suppose. are we talking in the suggested dosages or not? are we talking legal or not? are we meaning physical pain or emotional pain. if you mean emotional pain then i think illegal drugs numb that better than the legal ones.

I wish I had both the contacts and the sheer nerve to use illegal drugs (mostly marijuana) as I'm sure they do a better job of numbing both mental and physical pain. But...at my advanced age, spending time in a holding cell would be much worse than putting up with the pain :)

Found out, for sure, that my youngest son, 15 years old, Todd is involved in drugs. We know he is definitely smoking pot and rumors say he is doing acid and ecstasy. We (my husband & I ) bought a home testing kit yesterday, and surprisingly, he "didn't have to go". When he finally did, we gave him the cup and he "misunderstood" how to do it....(I won't bother with details).

Anyway, does anyone know how long drugs (other than pot) stay in a person's system? I really could have used this information because I was going to call someone to get information on how to get him assessed.

Also -- does anyone know if a person can be on something without anyone knowing? My son came home the other night and seemed fine. He was coherent and "seemed" fine. We received a call just before he came home from a mom that he and a bunch of kids were partying at her home without permission. She said she was told that my son supplied some of the beer. He had no alcohol on his breath either.

I call him slippery Todd. I know he's doing something, other than pot, but even with that...I don't see any physical signs he's using.

Hi mother of Todd.
I know that pot can stay in your system up to 6 months.It all depends on how much is inhale and how often smoked. Ectasy stays in your system for 3 days. The home kits are excellent especially for the convenience. It would be nice if he could watch a documentary on what drugs does to people lives and their bodies.

I am ashamed to admit I would have been slippery Mic. I knew how to cover up smells and pull myself together until my mom never knew what I was on. We would wash our hands because the joint would leave its smell on our fingers. Smell his coat and fingers but he will soon figure that out. I was in a drug free work place training today and how long drugs stay in you system is dependent on the individual. Pot last the longest. I can only tell you I was an unhappy 30 year old when I stopped using drugs. I am also a tired 46 year old finally finishing college. I wish someone would have beat some sense in me the day after I started. He will be beyond reason because the drugs are ruling him. Get professional help keep testing. He may hate you now but later he will apreiciate it. Don't enable him and trust is unpredictable. The drugs could become the greatest love in his live. Be strong.

Does anyone know what is involved in an assessment for drugs? I friend of mine is a local drug counselor in another school system and she suggested that my son get one. She explained that the assessment is a very long questionaire. I didn't think to ask her if he tests that he is addicted and it comes out that he is doing other drugs, what the next step is. I know I can find out myself when I make the call later, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having their teen tested. Thanks.

Just had my 15 YO son tested for pot, ecstasy, etc. WE did urine and hair at a private lab. $65 for hair. We were shocked that he passed. So were some of his friends. One told me he does smoke tobacco and another told me he smoked pot with him. When the friends are worried, I am terrified. But he passsed. He is extremely thin. My hubby says it is the body fat and that any test can be passed. he also rejects church....

So I'm a teenager, around Todd's age
I have no idea if your son is using other drugs without anyone knowing, but I'd like to tell you right now:
DO NOT TRUST OTHER PARENTS
I have no idea what your sons image is, but if he dresses punk, emo, goth, skater, etc, he will be judged. Trust me on that.
I'm not saying don't trust all parents. I'm saying keep your eyes open and remember that some are gonna judge and base their decisions on looks or a reputation...if your son did not have beer on his breath but the other kids mom said he supplied the beer, who should you believe? I don't know this mom, but she could be judging his looks or rep.

As for your son doing these drugs, I'd like to say that there should be consequences for this, but don't go completely behind his back
Something is wrong if he is doing this
Let him know he can talk to you, and if you think he's too uncomfortable, get an adult you think he is very comfortable with
And if nothing works at all, maybe therapy would...just try talking to him

good luck

i feel for you - we are damned if we know and damned if we don't. I think it is very important to call around some local testing sites for back-up to the home tests. Most will try everything to beat whatever - wherever the test is. Keep testing though. Maybe at some point, he will understand he is going to be held responsible for his actions (isn't this what we are all waiting for our teens to get?)
Comment(s):

Yes, your teen can be doing drugs and you are none the wiser until testing.

Consider asking him where the beer come from; another parent, an older contact, soliciting out in front of a store? If it is from an older friend, you might let him know that if you chose to you could press charges for supplying alcohol to a minor.... no kid wants to put their &quot;friend&quot; on the hook. Also, the friend may think that alcohol is not a big deal......but in this case - with the other drugs it is.

Yes pot stays in the system for a while. I don't believe that acid shows up in drug screening -- could be wrong. Ecstasy for just a short time. The kids really like the sensory of ecstasy experience but the new brain research shows that ecstasy has some long term effects on the brain; these are showing up as significant memory deficits at middle age.....you might share this fact with him. Further, this research is from the aging literature and not the anti-drug and so your son might consider the source a little more valid.....

My kids got sick of me saying that I did everything for healthy brain development during pregnancy and was going to see it through their teen years since the brain is still developing (they can actually see time lapsed imaging of the teen brain pruning synapses...very cool stuff!)

The questionnaires should only be given by people licensed to give, interpret and share the result. Also, tests are a dime a dozen, so be sure that it is the most appropriate diagnostic tool. Be sure to understand what the test can and CANNOT do. Consider asking your counselor/doctor/psychiatrist about any recommendations.

Finally, it is interesting to me that he is using drugs that have a lot of sensory attributes.....is this filling a neurological need, or social (boredom, fitting in and using the drug de jour) or escaping because of personal stress/depression????? He may not know and once again, here's hoping you find a good counselor.

This is a tough time - hang in there!

This is such an unsettling time for you and your family and my prayers go out to you. Do you (or Todd's father) have a decent relationship with him? Do you talk? Is he involved in sports? Cars/bikes? Do you know his friends by first name? How about his comings and goings? Are you aware of where he is and who he is with? I ask you this because this will help you both with this situation.
The tell-tale signs of the drugs vary with drug type and volume of use. Pot stays in your system the longest but can be flushed enough (with water and frequent urination) in order to pass the drug test. Other signs of pot use is the obvious; the smell, blood-shot eyes, sluggishness, increased appetite (the munchies), apathy. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior- sleeping more or less, different choice of music, different group of friends, loss of interest in usual activities, secretiveness. Most hallucinegenic drugs such as acid and ecstacy will give way to visual changes; fixation on lights and spinning objects. His pupils will most likely be large and dilated. These drugs are very sensory oriented- sight, sound, and touch are heightened. Acid and ex are very dangerous (all of them are for that matter) as most of these are synthetic and are therefor a mixture that can be lethal. You never know what you are taking or how your body will respond- it's like playing russian roulette. I do know that your personal psychological state at the time directly impacts the &quot;high&quot;. I knew someone in high school who was very stressed and he &quot;dropped&quot; some acid and had a bad &quot;trip&quot;- he has never been the same- it permanently affected his psyche- in otherwords, he went out of his mind! Teens these days are also into prescription drugs (percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, ritalin, adderal, etc.) They will also use inhalants (aerosol spray cans).
If you feel in your gut that there is a problem, seek help. I haven't checked out the support groups on this web site but there are groups in the community that can help. It's tough because of the teenage denial thing. At this point it's a matter of life and death!
My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

Thanks for all your support. I can't believe it's August and we are still at the tip of the iceberg with this drug thing. My husband and I have had Todd tested both in and outside a lab and some were negative and some positive. We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.12

We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.17

For those that have done drugs...
Would you have said no if you knew what was going to follow it?
I for one dont think I would have, drugs have brought so much pain to my life but at the same time some drugs make me happy, for once, TRULY happy, and that is something that is so hard to come by. But still, getting caught, grounded, and in shit tons of trouble, Im wondering if it was all worth it in the end. Has anyone else here done them and then realized the consequences of it?
Ive smoked pot, and opium, and I have done shrooms, acid and datura.
Has anyone here done these things, if you did, you should message me, I need more people to connect with when it comes to drug issues.

Has anyone taken doxepin with a antidepressant, I saw on a web site you couldn't take these together, I take 20mg of paxil daily and I quit the doxepin before I started on the paxil but I just can't get any sleep or very little, it doesn't matter how many hours I am up, I still have the doxepin and it is a low dose of 10 mg, I guess I just wanted to know if others have taken these drugs together, I am so paranoid about medicines, I go to my doctor but it is weeks away, no sleep is really getting to me. Would like to read your comments, thank you.

Hi Leeann,

I suggest you call your docs office and leave a message with the staff. Most docs will not mind returning the call especially when you have questions about meds/interactions etc. Another option would be to call your pharmacist. They will understand the medications too. As a last resort, try this free online drug interation checker: http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/druginterchecker

Remember, there are other sleep medications out there so you might find an alternative that you can take with Paxil. Also, keep in mind that antidepressant/antianxiety meds can take several weeks before you start to really benefit from them. Hopefully given enough time things will even out some and you'll be able to get some rest.

Here for you!

I'm a clean kid. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't have sex, I don't do drugs and I generally don't hang out with those who do. Where I'm from there aren't a lot of LGBT kids and but there is this one bi guy who is pretty cool. He was the one who I could talk about things with. He recently switched schools and I thought it would be good for him because he was in trouble at school and his home life was pretty rough and it would be good to get away from his sibs. (they still go to my school) He smokes, he drinks and he does drugs. He enjoys sex with anyone who will give it to him. Right after Christmas he overdosed. By some miracle he survived. I knew he was going to get into trouble but I didn't do anything. I didn't realize that he had hit rock bottom again. I've barely seen him this year and I can't believe this. I'm having trouble dealing with this. It scares me because I feel like I should have done something even though I haven't seen him and didn't know how bad things were. I've delt with a lot of shit this year and this is one I just don't know what to do about because I hate drugs and I don't approve of those who use them and I refuse to hang out with him if he's drunk or high and he's like my only friend who does drugs. I'm just freaking out a little bit and I hope that everything works out but I just don't know if it will

Probably not the best topic for Christmas, but I lost my baby sister to drugs on Tuesday. She had struggled for years with addictions. When she was straight she was a decent mom, who loved her kids. But sometimes the drugs were more important.
I'm mad at her, and the person who sold her the drugs. Whoever supplied her killed her. Period.
If any of those you love are involved with drugs in any way, get between them and the drugs in any way you can. I couldn't save my sister. Please try to save your loved one.

Oh Jan, I'm so sorry. So much pain this Christmas. Everybody is hurting. What can we do for you as a group? Is there anything you need to say or express regarding your sister, that would help you to heal? I pray God will help you through the grieving process. Cry and be mad even, if need be.

Lorie Ann, you have such a sweet heart.
I'm angry at her for caring more about getting high than her family. I know that's not true, but it's how I feel just now.
She's always been a mess. I'm angry at me for not spending more time trying to help her. I'm also worried sick about my mom.
But tomorrow is Christmas, and we will all get through it in our different ways. And then the day after life goes on. I'll be ok, but you are all dear to me and I don't want another family to go through this.

I am so incredibly sorry for your loss, Jan.

Death is never easy even in the best of circumstances.

We have been so busy with everything since my mom passed away on T-day this yr. I even last week forgot to pay all the bills. I found out when I tried to get online and had trouble so was trying to fix that all day with tech support. Next day phone was off, and cell phone, and gas bills were really late.So made me snap back into my routine. It is amazing how much time is envolved in taking care of everything when someone dies.

All that business though helped to keep the mind and body busy. So that was a blessing.

So very sorry about your sister. Your mom...she has lived thru alot. She is probably stronger than you realize. Try not to worry about her. She will be okay.

Wish there was something more I could say to help you thru this.

Love and Biggest Hugs!

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

I have severe arthritis but am allergic to most meds. If I have a bad attact &amp; take anything I find my body's acid levels go up &amp; I get gout attack. I was told by a natural therapist that a half teaspoon of bi-carb of soda (or I think its also called baking soda?) in a glass of water helps settle the stomach. I find this really helps...its basically the same ingredient as the ant-acid tablets you buy from the chemist store but a tiny fraction of the price!!! I found a great site on natural treatments using far infrared therapy with good tips at http://www.farinfraredmedical.org

My heart goes out to you in this time of your sorrow.
You are in the right place, it is what you need right now a compassionate listening ear and a shoulder to cry.
When the death is sudden it brings another set of issues to deal with while already in heart breaking agony grieving the loss.

I hope gradually you can find some comfort in your memories, and with the support of your family and friends, including your friends here, in DS site, your heart will start healing.
My husband too died suddenly , nothing prepared me for dealing with that tragedy. His death left many questions that I had to search for answers.,
I could not do it on my own, so I turned to my faith. I have been blessed with the support and kindness of many people to go through that time in my life.
I was seeking and luckily, I was finding all kinds of support groups, through church, mental health organizations, funeral home, non-profit organizations, and private therapy. I advise you do the same. We agonize the lose along, but we heal together.
Glad you are here. Stay with the DS, this site helped me through the toughest times. I am so eternally grateful.
Warmest hug,
Let the healing begin...

I lost my husband to a sudden heart attack on January 15. He wasn't sick at all. The shock was the first thing that hits . No this can't be true. No matter the reason for the heart attack the pain and shock is there. Then you start to second guess yourself, what did I miss. That part will drive you crazy if you let it. My first weeks were spent in all day crying and asking why. I found a support group that is really helping me to see that this grieve is normal and I'm not crazy. They had all been thru the different emotions at different times. It is a rough trip and I am sorry who have to travel it. Please come here often and share with us. Brenda

Thank you for all the kind words. I am here to talk to people that can maybe relate to my experience. There are two things that seem to bothering me the most. This first is that I didn't know...didn't see. The second is...I feel like everything from the very beginning was a lie. His family knew and they all, including him, knew my thoughts on drugs. I didn't want around them, let alone in my home. They were EVERYWHERE. I thank God my mom was able to be there with me. The cops, paramedics, and coroner actually stopped talking to me because they just kept throwing things at me that I no idea on....I coudn't handle any more and she stepped in and took control.

My husband was taking an anti-depressant medication that was not Rx'd to him, but *sampled* to him by his physician. Because of HIPPA law, I was not entitled to know or be made aware of- even though the first 9 days are critical &quot;watch&quot; days. He was on his third day of anti-depressant medication, but several pills were gone from the package. Other substances were consumed which ultimately lead to his death.

I felt so responsible because I was his wife- I should've known and helped him. I should've cared enough to find out and be aware (I called it respecting his space...but really- according to the Holy Scriptures- as his wife I owned him...likewise as my husband he owned me) I felt betrayed and violated all at once with his death and the circumstances thereof.

I remind myself all the time, this was not my fault. I couldn't have stopped him but for maybe a short time and even then it would be constant emotional blackmail to control me and garner my attention. Rather, I try to comfort myself with the knowledge that he is with our Lord Jesus Christ (he confessed Jesus as his Lord and Savior) in perfect peace, released from his internal mental hell.

Hope that helps.24

Do you think your doctor would order a blood workup that would show if you're lacking in any vitamins? You could be deficient in Iron, or Vitamin D, or Vitamin C any one of which could have you feeling fatigued if you were low on it. And probably lots of other ones.
Or do you think it might be one of the meds that you're on that is dragging you down? (I know you cut back on them, but even so.)

I have been taking Phentermine to help lose weight. You need a Rx for it, I only take 1/2 tab in the a.m. It did give me more energy, but lately since I started the Celexa it seems like I have more energy, even when I am not sleeping well lately. I hav lost 17 lbs so far also. Trying to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 120.. I have only taken if for about 1 1/2 mnths and don't get to exercise much either.. Just a suggestion, not sure if you can get a Rx for it or not.. Good luck!25

Found out, for sure, that my youngest son, 15 years old, Todd is involved in drugs. We know he is definitely smoking pot and rumors say he is doing acid and ecstasy. We (my husband & I ) bought a home testing kit yesterday, and surprisingly, he "didn't have to go". When he finally did, we gave him the cup and he "misunderstood" how to do it....(I won't bother with details).

Anyway, does anyone know how long drugs (other than pot) stay in a person's system? I really could have used this information because I was going to call someone to get information on how to get him assessed.

Also -- does anyone know if a person can be on something without anyone knowing? My son came home the other night and seemed fine. He was coherent and "seemed" fine. We received a call just before he came home from a mom that he and a bunch of kids were partying at her home without permission. She said she was told that my son supplied some of the beer. He had no alcohol on his breath either.

I call him slippery Todd. I know he's doing something, other than pot, but even with that...I don't see any physical signs he's using.

Hi mother of Todd.
I know that pot can stay in your system up to 6 months.It all depends on how much is inhale and how often smoked. Ectasy stays in your system for 3 days. The home kits are excellent especially for the convenience. It would be nice if he could watch a documentary on what drugs does to people lives and their bodies.

I am ashamed to admit I would have been slippery Mic. I knew how to cover up smells and pull myself together until my mom never knew what I was on. We would wash our hands because the joint would leave its smell on our fingers. Smell his coat and fingers but he will soon figure that out. I was in a drug free work place training today and how long drugs stay in you system is dependent on the individual. Pot last the longest. I can only tell you I was an unhappy 30 year old when I stopped using drugs. I am also a tired 46 year old finally finishing college. I wish someone would have beat some sense in me the day after I started. He will be beyond reason because the drugs are ruling him. Get professional help keep testing. He may hate you now but later he will apreiciate it. Don't enable him and trust is unpredictable. The drugs could become the greatest love in his live. Be strong.

Does anyone know what is involved in an assessment for drugs? I friend of mine is a local drug counselor in another school system and she suggested that my son get one. She explained that the assessment is a very long questionaire. I didn't think to ask her if he tests that he is addicted and it comes out that he is doing other drugs, what the next step is. I know I can find out myself when I make the call later, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having their teen tested. Thanks.

So I'm a teenager, around Todd's age
I have no idea if your son is using other drugs without anyone knowing, but I'd like to tell you right now:
DO NOT TRUST OTHER PARENTS
I have no idea what your sons image is, but if he dresses punk, emo, goth, skater, etc, he will be judged. Trust me on that.
I'm not saying don't trust all parents. I'm saying keep your eyes open and remember that some are gonna judge and base their decisions on looks or a reputation...if your son did not have beer on his breath but the other kids mom said he supplied the beer, who should you believe? I don't know this mom, but she could be judging his looks or rep.

As for your son doing these drugs, I'd like to say that there should be consequences for this, but don't go completely behind his back
Something is wrong if he is doing this
Let him know he can talk to you, and if you think he's too uncomfortable, get an adult you think he is very comfortable with
And if nothing works at all, maybe therapy would...just try talking to him

good luck

i feel for you - we are damned if we know and damned if we don't. I think it is very important to call around some local testing sites for back-up to the home tests. Most will try everything to beat whatever - wherever the test is. Keep testing though. Maybe at some point, he will understand he is going to be held responsible for his actions (isn't this what we are all waiting for our teens to get?)
Comment(s):

Yes, your teen can be doing drugs and you are none the wiser until testing.

Consider asking him where the beer come from; another parent, an older contact, soliciting out in front of a store? If it is from an older friend, you might let him know that if you chose to you could press charges for supplying alcohol to a minor.... no kid wants to put their &quot;friend&quot; on the hook. Also, the friend may think that alcohol is not a big deal......but in this case - with the other drugs it is.

Yes pot stays in the system for a while. I don't believe that acid shows up in drug screening -- could be wrong. Ecstasy for just a short time. The kids really like the sensory of ecstasy experience but the new brain research shows that ecstasy has some long term effects on the brain; these are showing up as significant memory deficits at middle age.....you might share this fact with him. Further, this research is from the aging literature and not the anti-drug and so your son might consider the source a little more valid.....

My kids got sick of me saying that I did everything for healthy brain development during pregnancy and was going to see it through their teen years since the brain is still developing (they can actually see time lapsed imaging of the teen brain pruning synapses...very cool stuff!)

The questionnaires should only be given by people licensed to give, interpret and share the result. Also, tests are a dime a dozen, so be sure that it is the most appropriate diagnostic tool. Be sure to understand what the test can and CANNOT do. Consider asking your counselor/doctor/psychiatrist about any recommendations.

Finally, it is interesting to me that he is using drugs that have a lot of sensory attributes.....is this filling a neurological need, or social (boredom, fitting in and using the drug de jour) or escaping because of personal stress/depression????? He may not know and once again, here's hoping you find a good counselor.

This is a tough time - hang in there!

This is such an unsettling time for you and your family and my prayers go out to you. Do you (or Todd's father) have a decent relationship with him? Do you talk? Is he involved in sports? Cars/bikes? Do you know his friends by first name? How about his comings and goings? Are you aware of where he is and who he is with? I ask you this because this will help you both with this situation.
The tell-tale signs of the drugs vary with drug type and volume of use. Pot stays in your system the longest but can be flushed enough (with water and frequent urination) in order to pass the drug test. Other signs of pot use is the obvious; the smell, blood-shot eyes, sluggishness, increased appetite (the munchies), apathy. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior- sleeping more or less, different choice of music, different group of friends, loss of interest in usual activities, secretiveness. Most hallucinegenic drugs such as acid and ecstacy will give way to visual changes; fixation on lights and spinning objects. His pupils will most likely be large and dilated. These drugs are very sensory oriented- sight, sound, and touch are heightened. Acid and ex are very dangerous (all of them are for that matter) as most of these are synthetic and are therefor a mixture that can be lethal. You never know what you are taking or how your body will respond- it's like playing russian roulette. I do know that your personal psychological state at the time directly impacts the &quot;high&quot;. I knew someone in high school who was very stressed and he &quot;dropped&quot; some acid and had a bad &quot;trip&quot;- he has never been the same- it permanently affected his psyche- in otherwords, he went out of his mind! Teens these days are also into prescription drugs (percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, ritalin, adderal, etc.) They will also use inhalants (aerosol spray cans).
If you feel in your gut that there is a problem, seek help. I haven't checked out the support groups on this web site but there are groups in the community that can help. It's tough because of the teenage denial thing. At this point it's a matter of life and death!
My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

My husband and I have had Todd tested both in and outside a lab and some were negative and some positive. We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.27

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

Seeing that things seem to be getting worse it could be Bipolar Disorder. Have you done anything real erratic that you wouldn't normally do or spent a large amount of money on one purchase or what you did purchase hide it from others?28

Provigil/Nuvigil? It's RX only and a bit pricey. I didn't like it though and had a weird reaction where it actually made me tired, though that is really an extremely odd reaction.. It is normally prescribed for narcoleptics, people with sleep apnea, off label for people with fibromyalgia - things like that..

Do you think your doctor would order a blood workup that would show if you're lacking in any vitamins? You could be deficient in Iron, or Vitamin D, or Vitamin C any one of which could have you feeling fatigued if you were low on it. And probably lots of other ones.
Or do you think it might be one of the meds that you're on that is dragging you down? (I know you cut back on them, but even so.)
Good luck, dorkie!!! I hope you find something that works!!! (((((Hugs)))))

I have been taking Phentermine to help lose weight. You need a Rx for it, I only take 1/2 tab in the a.m. It did give me more energy, but lately since I started the Celexa it seems like I have more energy, even when I am not sleeping well lately. I hav lost 17 lbs so far also. Trying to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 120.. I have only taken if for about 1 1/2 mnths and don't get to exercise much either.. Just a suggestion, not sure if you can get a Rx for it or not.. Good luck!29

I wish I had both the contacts and the sheer nerve to use illegal drugs (mostly marijuana) as I'm sure they do a better job of numbing both mental and physical pain. But...at my advanced age, spending time in a holding cell would be much worse than putting up with the pain :)

Can you get addicted to phenergan? I take it at least 4 times a day. I am constantly nauseated. I do by best to keep from vomiting because it can cause my GJ tube to twist and kink (it has on several occasions). Sometimes, if I time it just right, I can make it to the bathroom in time to drain my stomach using the G valve on my tube. Other times, I end up using one of the trash cans that are strategically placed around my apartment.

Zofran just doesn't cut it.

As for the pain medications, they work well. I take oxycodone every 8 hours for the "standard" pain and dilaudid every 4 hours for the "severe" pain. One of the side effects of opiate pain medications is itching so I have had to add benadryl to the mix. Oxy and dilaudid both make me drowsy and dizzy. Benadryl adds to that so I'm in a total fog. I'm lucky I have some friends who are willing to provide me with transportation to doctor appointments and such for times when I'm under the influence. I live less than 2 miles from my "home" hospital so I can take a cab if necessary.

The pain medications are hard to find. I get them from a mom-and-pop type pharmacy where they can be "compounded" if they are not in stock.

I am very careful with the oxy and dilaudid. When I see my pain specialist every month, I always still have leftovers from the previous month. I have yet to be called in for a pill count or drug screen. He says I'm one of the few he can trust not to abuse the medications.

Here's something funny...about 9-10 months ago, I signed up for a dating site to give it a try. I met someone...a guy who is a couple of years younger than me. We have a lot in common and have developed a close friendship. We are not dating but we have one thing in common that shocked us both...we BOTH have CP!! Whoa. What are the odds of that? I've been out on casual dates...until I sort of gave up...but those guys would run for the hills once I told them about the CP.

I'm rambling again. I'm sorry about that. Anyway, I'm enjoying some nice weather here in Atlanta. I'm sitting out on my deck, relaxing and for once, not in all that much pain. I'm sipping on fat free chocolate milk (an indulgence) and making plans for an upcoming trip to Disney World. I'll be back tomorrow.

About phenergan...are you on the plain or the one that has codeine added to it? Did you know that phenergan was used as a antihistamine for allergies? For me phenergan makes me sleepy, I take 1/2 of a 25mg tab for my nausea. I dont take it daily. But if you are on plain phenergan i dont think you can become addicted to it, you might be anxious because of your j tube and dont want it to get kinked maybe? The one thing you have to watch out for is parkinson type of adverse reaction to the phenergan, that is why i dont take it on a regular basis. In the hospital zofran would work at first but then it wouldnt and then i would be put on phenergan iv....but it burns the veins so they would put it way up high on my iv fluid line to not burn as it enters the vein.
Well I hope you and that guy are still talking and maybe having this CP in common will help with you and him getting closer?

I take the plain phenergan...25 mg every 4 hours as needed for severe nausea. Since I already take oxycodone and dilaudid, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to have codeine mixed in.

I have tardive dyskinesia from the drug Reglan, which I took for a few months about 5 years ago. The side effects from it are very similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's. I took it for my gastroparesis but they were intolerable and I stopped. Unfortunately, the side effects are permanent and I now take Mirapex to control them. I will have to for the rest of my life.

I now take Bentyl for the gastroparesis. I have no problems with it.

As for me and my friend...yes, we still talk. In fact, we have become very close. Will we start dating? We don't know. We are taking things slowly. I never dreamed I would meet someone that had CP too...and on a dating site. I was ready to give up and just stay single. It takes a special person to be able to handle a disease like this.33

My heart goes out to you in this time of your sorrow.
You are in the right place, it is what you need right now a compassionate listening ear and a shoulder to cry.
When the death is sudden it brings another set of issues to deal with while already in heart breaking agony grieving the loss.

I hope gradually you can find some comfort in your memories, and with the support of your family and friends, including your friends here, in DS site, your heart will start healing.
My husband too died suddenly , nothing prepared me for dealing with that tragedy. His death left many questions that I had to search for answers.,
I could not do it on my own, so I turned to my faith. I have been blessed with the support and kindness of many people to go through that time in my life.
I was seeking and luckily, I was finding all kinds of support groups, through church, mental health organizations, funeral home, non-profit organizations, and private therapy. I advise you do the same. We agonize the lose along, but we heal together.
Glad you are here. Stay with the DS, this site helped me through the toughest times. I am so eternally grateful.
Warmest hug,
Let the healing begin...

I lost my husband to a sudden heart attack on January 15. He wasn't sick at all. The shock was the first thing that hits . No this can't be true. No matter the reason for the heart attack the pain and shock is there. Then you start to second guess yourself, what did I miss. That part will drive you crazy if you let it. My first weeks were spent in all day crying and asking why. I found a support group that is really helping me to see that this grieve is normal and I'm not crazy. They had all been thru the different emotions at different times. It is a rough trip and I am sorry who have to travel it. Please come here often and share with us. Brenda

Thank you for all the kind words. I am here to talk to people that can maybe relate to my experience. There are two things that seem to bothering me the most. This first is that I didn't know...didn't see. The second is...I feel like everything from the very beginning was a lie. His family knew and they all, including him, knew my thoughts on drugs. I didn't want around them, let alone in my home. They were EVERYWHERE. I thank God my mom was able to be there with me. The cops, paramedics, and coroner actually stopped talking to me because they just kept throwing things at me that I no idea on....I coudn't handle any more and she stepped in and took control.

My husband was taking an anti-depressant medication that was not Rx'd to him, but *sampled* to him by his physician. Because of HIPPA law, I was not entitled to know or be made aware of- even though the first 9 days are critical &quot;watch&quot; days. He was on his third day of anti-depressant medication, but several pills were gone from the package. Other substances were consumed which ultimately lead to his death.

I felt so responsible because I was his wife- I should've known and helped him. I should've cared enough to find out and be aware (I called it respecting his space...but really- according to the Holy Scriptures- as his wife I owned him...likewise as my husband he owned me) I felt betrayed and violated all at once with his death and the circumstances thereof.

I remind myself all the time, this was not my fault. I couldn't have stopped him but for maybe a short time and even then it would be constant emotional blackmail to control me and garner my attention. Rather, I try to comfort myself with the knowledge that he is with our Lord Jesus Christ (he confessed Jesus as his Lord and Savior) in perfect peace, released from his internal mental hell.

Hope that helps.34

Probably not the best topic for Christmas, but I lost my baby sister to drugs on Tuesday. She had struggled for years with addictions. When she was straight she was a decent mom, who loved her kids. But sometimes the drugs were more important.
I'm mad at her, and the person who sold her the drugs. Whoever supplied her killed her. Period.
If any of those you love are involved with drugs in any way, get between them and the drugs in any way you can. I couldn't save my sister. Please try to save your loved one.

But tomorrow is Christmas, and we will all get through it in our different ways. And then the day after life goes on. I'll be ok, but you are all dear to me and I don't want another family to go through this.

I am so incredibly sorry for your loss, Jan.

Death is never easy even in the best of circumstances.

We have been so busy with everything since my mom passed away on T-day this yr. I even last week forgot to pay all the bills. I found out when I tried to get online and had trouble so was trying to fix that all day with tech support. Next day phone was off, and cell phone, and gas bills were really late.So made me snap back into my routine. It is amazing how much time is envolved in taking care of everything when someone dies.

All that business though helped to keep the mind and body busy. So that was a blessing.

So very sorry about your sister. Your mom...she has lived thru alot. She is probably stronger than you realize. Try not to worry about her. She will be okay.

Wish there was something more I could say to help you thru this.

Love and Biggest Hugs!

Seeing that things seem to be getting worse it could be Bipolar Disorder. Have you done anything real erratic that you wouldn't normally do or spent a large amount of money on one purchase or what you did purchase hide it from others?42

Hi,

I take ibruprofen daily and it is a great way to keep severe pain at a lower level. I have taken it all my life. it used to upset my stomarch but now i am fine - generally it is the best pain killer i have experienced because it doesn\'t cause drowsiness.

Do you take anything for your stomach to combat ibu\'s effects? I take Prevacid. The only problem I had was that I had to take 800mg 3x/day! That was the therapeutic limit, and I still had some problems.

I have severe arthritis but am allergic to most meds. If I have a bad attact &amp; take anything I find my body's acid levels go up &amp; I get gout attack. I was told by a natural therapist that a half teaspoon of bi-carb of soda (or I think its also called baking soda?) in a glass of water helps settle the stomach. I find this really helps...its basically the same ingredient as the ant-acid tablets you buy from the chemist store but a tiny fraction of the price!!! I found a great site on natural treatments using far infrared therapy with good tips at http://www.farinfraredmedical.org
I've found keeping it simple is best...cheers.

Hi, I am new on here. I thought I would try talking to other people outside of my family and friends. I lost my husband Jan. 29 of this year. He passed away due to cardiac arrest from an over dose of drugs. I was totally and compleltly unaware he was taking anything. It all has been such a huge shock. I was hoping to find some people that maybe would understand what I'm going throough.

My heart goes out to you in this time of your sorrow.
You are in the right place, it is what you need right now a compassionate listening ear and a shoulder to cry.
When the death is sudden it brings another set of issues to deal with while already in heart breaking agony grieving the loss.

I hope gradually you can find some comfort in your memories, and with the support of your family and friends, including your friends here, in DS site, your heart will start healing.
My husband too died suddenly , nothing prepared me for dealing with that tragedy. His death left many questions that I had to search for answers.,
I could not do it on my own, so I turned to my faith. I have been blessed with the support and kindness of many people to go through that time in my life.
I was seeking and luckily, I was finding all kinds of support groups, through church, mental health organizations, funeral home, non-profit organizations, and private therapy. I advise you do the same. We agonize the lose along, but we heal together.
Glad you are here. Stay with the DS, this site helped me through the toughest times. I am so eternally grateful.
Warmest hug,
Let the healing begin...

I lost my husband to a sudden heart attack on January 15. He wasn't sick at all. The shock was the first thing that hits . No this can't be true. No matter the reason for the heart attack the pain and shock is there. Then you start to second guess yourself, what did I miss. That part will drive you crazy if you let it. My first weeks were spent in all day crying and asking why. I found a support group that is really helping me to see that this grieve is normal and I'm not crazy. They had all been thru the different emotions at different times. It is a rough trip and I am sorry who have to travel it. Please come here often and share with us. Brenda

Thank you for all the kind words. I am here to talk to people that can maybe relate to my experience. There are two things that seem to bothering me the most. This first is that I didn't know...didn't see. The second is...I feel like everything from the very beginning was a lie. His family knew and they all, including him, knew my thoughts on drugs. I didn't want around them, let alone in my home. They were EVERYWHERE. I thank God my mom was able to be there with me. The cops, paramedics, and coroner actually stopped talking to me because they just kept throwing things at me that I no idea on....I coudn't handle any more and she stepped in and took control.

My husband was taking an anti-depressant medication that was not Rx'd to him, but *sampled* to him by his physician. Because of HIPPA law, I was not entitled to know or be made aware of- even though the first 9 days are critical &quot;watch&quot; days. He was on his third day of anti-depressant medication, but several pills were gone from the package. Other substances were consumed which ultimately lead to his death.

I felt so responsible because I was his wife- I should've known and helped him. I should've cared enough to find out and be aware (I called it respecting his space...but really- according to the Holy Scriptures- as his wife I owned him...likewise as my husband he owned me) I felt betrayed and violated all at once with his death and the circumstances thereof.

I remind myself all the time, this was not my fault. I couldn't have stopped him but for maybe a short time and even then it would be constant emotional blackmail to control me and garner my attention. Rather, I try to comfort myself with the knowledge that he is with our Lord Jesus Christ (he confessed Jesus as his Lord and Savior) in perfect peace, released from his internal mental hell.

Hope that helps.44

Do you think your doctor would order a blood workup that would show if you're lacking in any vitamins? You could be deficient in Iron, or Vitamin D, or Vitamin C any one of which could have you feeling fatigued if you were low on it. And probably lots of other ones.
Or do you think it might be one of the meds that you're on that is dragging you down? (I know you cut back on them, but even so.)

I have been taking Phentermine to help lose weight. You need a Rx for it, I only take 1/2 tab in the a.m. It did give me more energy, but lately since I started the Celexa it seems like I have more energy, even when I am not sleeping well lately. I hav lost 17 lbs so far also. Trying to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 120.. I have only taken if for about 1 1/2 mnths and don't get to exercise much either.. Just a suggestion, not sure if you can get a Rx for it or not.. Good luck!45

Found out, for sure, that my youngest son, 15 years old, Todd is involved in drugs. We know he is definitely smoking pot and rumors say he is doing acid and ecstasy. We (my husband & I ) bought a home testing kit yesterday, and surprisingly, he "didn't have to go". When he finally did, we gave him the cup and he "misunderstood" how to do it....(I won't bother with details).

Anyway, does anyone know how long drugs (other than pot) stay in a person's system? I really could have used this information because I was going to call someone to get information on how to get him assessed.

Also -- does anyone know if a person can be on something without anyone knowing? My son came home the other night and seemed fine. He was coherent and "seemed" fine. We received a call just before he came home from a mom that he and a bunch of kids were partying at her home without permission. She said she was told that my son supplied some of the beer. He had no alcohol on his breath either.

I call him slippery Todd. I know he's doing something, other than pot, but even with that...I don't see any physical signs he's using.

Hi mother of Todd.
I know that pot can stay in your system up to 6 months.It all depends on how much is inhale and how often smoked. Ectasy stays in your system for 3 days. The home kits are excellent especially for the convenience. It would be nice if he could watch a documentary on what drugs does to people lives and their bodies.

I am ashamed to admit I would have been slippery Mic. I knew how to cover up smells and pull myself together until my mom never knew what I was on. We would wash our hands because the joint would leave its smell on our fingers. Smell his coat and fingers but he will soon figure that out. I was in a drug free work place training today and how long drugs stay in you system is dependent on the individual. Pot last the longest. I can only tell you I was an unhappy 30 year old when I stopped using drugs. I am also a tired 46 year old finally finishing college. I wish someone would have beat some sense in me the day after I started. He will be beyond reason because the drugs are ruling him. Get professional help keep testing. He may hate you now but later he will apreiciate it. Don't enable him and trust is unpredictable. The drugs could become the greatest love in his live. Be strong.

Does anyone know what is involved in an assessment for drugs? I friend of mine is a local drug counselor in another school system and she suggested that my son get one. She explained that the assessment is a very long questionaire. I didn't think to ask her if he tests that he is addicted and it comes out that he is doing other drugs, what the next step is. I know I can find out myself when I make the call later, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having their teen tested. Thanks.

So I'm a teenager, around Todd's age
I have no idea if your son is using other drugs without anyone knowing, but I'd like to tell you right now:
DO NOT TRUST OTHER PARENTS
I have no idea what your sons image is, but if he dresses punk, emo, goth, skater, etc, he will be judged. Trust me on that.
I'm not saying don't trust all parents. I'm saying keep your eyes open and remember that some are gonna judge and base their decisions on looks or a reputation...if your son did not have beer on his breath but the other kids mom said he supplied the beer, who should you believe? I don't know this mom, but she could be judging his looks or rep.

As for your son doing these drugs, I'd like to say that there should be consequences for this, but don't go completely behind his back
Something is wrong if he is doing this
Let him know he can talk to you, and if you think he's too uncomfortable, get an adult you think he is very comfortable with
And if nothing works at all, maybe therapy would...just try talking to him

good luck

i feel for you - we are damned if we know and damned if we don't. I think it is very important to call around some local testing sites for back-up to the home tests. Most will try everything to beat whatever - wherever the test is. Keep testing though. Maybe at some point, he will understand he is going to be held responsible for his actions (isn't this what we are all waiting for our teens to get?)
Comment(s):
deleted_user 9 years ago
Yes, your teen can be doing drugs and you are none the wiser until testing.

Consider asking him where the beer come from; another parent, an older contact, soliciting out in front of a store? If it is from an older friend, you might let him know that if you chose to you could press charges for supplying alcohol to a minor.... no kid wants to put their &quot;friend&quot; on the hook. Also, the friend may think that alcohol is not a big deal......but in this case - with the other drugs it is.

Yes pot stays in the system for a while. I don't believe that acid shows up in drug screening -- could be wrong. Ecstasy for just a short time. The kids really like the sensory of ecstasy experience but the new brain research shows that ecstasy has some long term effects on the brain; these are showing up as significant memory deficits at middle age.....you might share this fact with him. Further, this research is from the aging literature and not the anti-drug and so your son might consider the source a little more valid.....

My kids got sick of me saying that I did everything for healthy brain development during pregnancy and was going to see it through their teen years since the brain is still developing (they can actually see time lapsed imaging of the teen brain pruning synapses...very cool stuff!)

The questionnaires should only be given by people licensed to give, interpret and share the result. Also, tests are a dime a dozen, so be sure that it is the most appropriate diagnostic tool. Be sure to understand what the test can and CANNOT do. Consider asking your counselor/doctor/psychiatrist about any recommendations.

Finally, it is interesting to me that he is using drugs that have a lot of sensory attributes.....is this filling a neurological need, or social (boredom, fitting in and using the drug de jour) or escaping because of personal stress/depression????? He may not know and once again, here's hoping you find a good counselor.

This is a tough time - hang in there!

This is such an unsettling time for you and your family and my prayers go out to you. Do you (or Todd's father) have a decent relationship with him? Do you talk? Is he involved in sports? Cars/bikes? Do you know his friends by first name? How about his comings and goings? Are you aware of where he is and who he is with? I ask you this because this will help you both with this situation.
The tell-tale signs of the drugs vary with drug type and volume of use. Pot stays in your system the longest but can be flushed enough (with water and frequent urination) in order to pass the drug test. Other signs of pot use is the obvious; the smell, blood-shot eyes, sluggishness, increased appetite (the munchies), apathy. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior- sleeping more or less, different choice of music, different group of friends, loss of interest in usual activities, secretiveness. Most hallucinegenic drugs such as acid and ecstacy will give way to visual changes; fixation on lights and spinning objects. His pupils will most likely be large and dilated. These drugs are very sensory oriented- sight, sound, and touch are heightened. Acid and ex are very dangerous (all of them are for that matter) as most of these are synthetic and are therefor a mixture that can be lethal. You never know what you are taking or how your body will respond- it's like playing russian roulette. I do know that your personal psychological state at the time directly impacts the &quot;high&quot;. I knew someone in high school who was very stressed and he &quot;dropped&quot; some acid and had a bad &quot;trip&quot;- he has never been the same- it permanently affected his psyche- in otherwords, he went out of his mind! Teens these days are also into prescription drugs (percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, ritalin, adderal, etc.) They will also use inhalants (aerosol spray cans).
If you feel in your gut that there is a problem, seek help. I haven't checked out the support groups on this web site but there are groups in the community that can help. It's tough because of the teenage denial thing. At this point it's a matter of life and death!
My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

Thanks for all your support. I can't believe it's August and we are still at the tip of the iceberg with this drug thing. My husband and I have had Todd tested both in and outside a lab and some were negative and some positive. We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.47

they put secret alien eggs in the pills and the alien baby climbs up to your brain and tickles it to you are happy (sorry just kidding with you)

but when i first took them, i actually flushed them, and refused. of course the psychiatrist(s) i had was a incompetent baboon. however once my general doctor got involved (he helped my dad a lot) i got more compassionate care, and got the right meds. so its a fight of course.

if you are apprehensive (spelt wrong i am sure) i'd suggest just making a list of the good and the bad, and if you want show it to your doctor, and ask him what he/her thinks, and ask him all sorts of questions. grill him/her and get the answers you want. side effects, complications, benefits, and then from there come to a conclusion. and of course if you want ask about alternatives (but i'd suggest declining ECT or a lobotomy or a insulin induced coma)

I hate the biannual blood draws to see if the meds are screwing with my liver or kidneys.....hate refilling the Rx every damn month..and just generally hate taking pills.

I never intended to take a pill to be happier every day for the rest of my life.
They did a good job for that year after my Mom died....it really helped me refocus, and be more positive, and less overwhelmed.

This is my two cents.
I believe that medicine should be used as a last resort. Many times, depression has a physical reason.
You could be anemic, have an underactive thyroid, be lethargic through being inactive, have a bad diet, etc.
First, I say you have a physical to rule out any physical factors.
Also try to watch what you eat, and try an exercise plan.
If this does not work, then it is more likely that you have a chemical imbalance as opposed to a physical ailment and I would consider medication.
Then, I would try a small dose and try to stick with the lowest effective dose. If the drug doesn't work at a low dose, have your doctor slowly increase it. Do not allow them to just start you off with a really high dose unless you are deeply troubled.
Yes, medication can be a bitch to get off of at times, but it can me a lifesaver as well.
No doubt klonopin saved my life regardless of how much I hate it.

I don't know what to say really, the OP asked for very specific responses. Dependency can happen but If you are afraid you are TOO depressed then living is what you're choosing because you're afraid of falling too far. In my case deep physical pain pretty much MADE me choose meds. I know others choose not to but pain is a powerful catalyst.

Dependency is a risk you do have to weigh in but if you feel the benefit outweighs the detriment (direct or indirect) that's what sways the decision. The alternative of natural supplements can be weighed also but that too is a dependency, you have to keep taking them and are dependent on something to help also.

Good luck in your decision. I hope you come back and tell us you are doing well.

Kuno made a good point that there may be other problems I.E. thyroid. Both my father and aunt have slow thyroids, that it took their general doctors.

that could be something to ask your doctor. i believe blood work shows that result.

All you can do is try. After a bit of time, and you decide you don't like it, you can always talk to your dr about it and get off them. Just don't quit cold turkey... that can really screw you up... If your dr doesn't want to work with you, get a new dr. a physical is never a bad idea either...52

Hi,

I take ibruprofen daily and it is a great way to keep severe pain at a lower level. I have taken it all my life. it used to upset my stomarch but now i am fine - generally it is the best pain killer i have experienced because it doesn\'t cause drowsiness.

Do you take anything for your stomach to combat ibu\'s effects? I take Prevacid. The only problem I had was that I had to take 800mg 3x/day! That was the therapeutic limit, and I still had some problems.

I have severe arthritis but am allergic to most meds. If I have a bad attact &amp; take anything I find my body's acid levels go up &amp; I get gout attack. I was told by a natural therapist that a half teaspoon of bi-carb of soda (or I think its also called baking soda?) in a glass of water helps settle the stomach. I find this really helps...its basically the same ingredient as the ant-acid tablets you buy from the chemist store but a tiny fraction of the price!!! I found a great site on natural treatments using far infrared therapy with good tips at http://www.farinfraredmedical.org
I've found keeping it simple is best...cheers.

Hi, I am new on here. I thought I would try talking to other people outside of my family and friends. I lost my husband Jan. 29 of this year.

I was hoping to find some people that maybe would understand what I'm going throough.

My heart goes out to you in this time of your sorrow.
You are in the right place, it is what you need right now a compassionate listening ear and a shoulder to cry.
When the death is sudden it brings another set of issues to deal with while already in heart breaking agony grieving the loss.

I hope gradually you can find some comfort in your memories, and with the support of your family and friends, including your friends here, in DS site, your heart will start healing.
My husband too died suddenly , nothing prepared me for dealing with that tragedy. His death left many questions that I had to search for answers.,
I could not do it on my own, so I turned to my faith. I have been blessed with the support and kindness of many people to go through that time in my life.
I was seeking and luckily, I was finding all kinds of support groups, through church, mental health organizations, funeral home, non-profit organizations, and private therapy. I advise you do the same. We agonize the lose along, but we heal together.
Glad you are here. Stay with the DS, this site helped me through the toughest times. I am so eternally grateful.
Warmest hug,
Let the healing begin...

I lost my husband to a sudden heart attack on January 15. He wasn't sick at all. The shock was the first thing that hits . No this can't be true. No matter the reason for the heart attack the pain and shock is there. Then you start to second guess yourself, what did I miss. That part will drive you crazy if you let it. My first weeks were spent in all day crying and asking why. I found a support group that is really helping me to see that this grieve is normal and I'm not crazy. They had all been thru the different emotions at different times. It is a rough trip and I am sorry who have to travel it. Please come here often and share with us. Brenda

Thank you for all the kind words. I am here to talk to people that can maybe relate to my experience. There are two things that seem to bothering me the most. This first is that I didn't know...didn't see. The second is...I feel like everything from the very beginning was a lie. His family knew and they all, including him, knew my thoughts on drugs. I didn't want around them, let alone in my home. They were EVERYWHERE. I thank God my mom was able to be there with me. The cops, paramedics, and coroner actually stopped talking to me because they just kept throwing things at me that I no idea on....I coudn't handle any more and she stepped in and took control.

My husband was taking an anti-depressant medication that was not Rx'd to him, but *sampled* to him by his physician. Because of HIPPA law, I was not entitled to know or be made aware of- even though the first 9 days are critical &quot;watch&quot; days. He was on his third day of anti-depressant medication, but several pills were gone from the package. Other substances were consumed which ultimately lead to his death.

I felt so responsible because I was his wife- I should've known and helped him. I should've cared enough to find out and be aware (I called it respecting his space...but really- according to the Holy Scriptures- as his wife I owned him...likewise as my husband he owned me) I felt betrayed and violated all at once with his death and the circumstances thereof.

I remind myself all the time, this was not my fault. I couldn't have stopped him but for maybe a short time and even then it would be constant emotional blackmail to control me and garner my attention. Rather, I try to comfort myself with the knowledge that he is with our Lord Jesus Christ (he confessed Jesus as his Lord and Savior) in perfect peace, released from his internal mental hell.

Hope that helps.54

Provigil/Nuvigil? It's RX only and a bit pricey. I didn't like it though and had a weird reaction where it actually made me tired, though that is really an extremely odd reaction..

Do you think your doctor would order a blood workup that would show if you're lacking in any vitamins? You could be deficient in Iron, or Vitamin D, or Vitamin C any one of which could have you feeling fatigued if you were low on it. And probably lots of other ones.
Or do you think it might be one of the meds that you're on that is dragging you down? (I know you cut back on them, but even so.)
Good luck, dorkie!!! I hope you find something that works!!! (((((Hugs)))))

I have been taking Phentermine to help lose weight. You need a Rx for it, I only take 1/2 tab in the a.m. It did give me more energy, but lately since I started the Celexa it seems like I have more energy, even when I am not sleeping well lately. I hav lost 17 lbs so far also. Trying to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 120.. I have only taken if for about 1 1/2 mnths and don't get to exercise much either.. Just a suggestion, not sure if you can get a Rx for it or not.. Good luck!55

yes. Mine left because he needs money to pay his child support and I am not willing to give him what money that I have worked hard to save for myself and my son. His ex-girlfriend is willing and I know that for a fact because I saw the email(by accident) that she sent to him begging for him to come back to her. That she will pay for his lawyer, pay off his motorcycle and bring his child support arrearage (75,000.) to zero. His contempt of court date is Sept. 1. I cannot compete with that and you can not compete with cocaine and you and I can not keep justifying these behaviors of these men.

I don&#039;t give a darn if my X was with Jennifer Lopez...I am still beautiful and loveable (so are you ladies). Besides a good woman (such as you) wouldn&#039;t want that N anyway. So irisheyes and itgurl ~let them have them...the drugs and all.

luvthyself, i feel that you misunderstand what i have meant to say. It kinda goes along the line of the 12 step programs. the first step is the acceptance that we are powerless over our addiction. I certainly do not want a man to be with me because of money, if i did i would&#039;ave happily handed over my checkbook to him and im sure that he would&#039;ave been happy to stay. I made the conscience choice not to do that. He didnt know that i had seen the email from her. I know with absolute certainty that once he is out of the woods with this child support thing that he will move on from her because you see ,I have seen him on the dating site plentyofish on a daily basis. I dodged a huge bullet, but all of this still doesnt take away the pain and the realization and acceptance that I am powerless over this addiction. This is MY problem and it has very little to do with HIM. This is what i mean by competition. There is no competition because I have no power. Simple as that.

Im not sure what she does for a living. I believe it to be healthcare of some kind. I will tell you that she is ten years older than me. and PATTY.......... yes i will say it again. She looks riden hard and put out wet. I hope that i am prepared to see her on this site in the not too far future from now. She actually had the nerve to facebook me and suggest that I read Co-dependant No More and Woman Who Love Too Much. She has no idea about his daily presence on plentyofish and I think there is some denial going on with her. I am glad that she has those books, though. She&#039;s going to be needing them.
Comment(s):
deleted_user 5 years ago
So if she knows about these books, must mean she&#039;s read them, which would lead one to believe that perhaps she has some issues. Heck, maybe she&#039;s a narc, too, and she&#039;s doing that projection thing by telling you to read those books. In time, you are right itgurl, she&#039;ll know how he is. I used to get so upset (and this actually is one of the reasons it was so hard to leave my exhusband) at the thought of him marrying someone else and giving her the life he never gave me. After reading everything I&#039;ve read about narcs, I know that whoever he does marry, she&#039;ll suffer the same as I did. He&#039;s incapable of being a good husband as it sounds like your ex is incapable of being a good (husband, boyfriend, etc.). Let her discover on her own the dating website thing. She may not believe you if you told her about him. God knows I didn&#039;t believe people when they said my exhusband was cheating. I couldn&#039;t see it until I was ready. Good luck.

from what i understand, from his sister, who was my friend in highschool, that this is her third time taking him back in 3 years You see he was my highschool boyfriend in the 80&#039;s, we broke up in 87 and have ten years of NC we got back together for two years and then had 12ys NC and this time it only lasted 6months. But this has followed me my whole life. I guess that he left his wife of ten years for her. Anyhow it isnt my problem anymore and they are in a very small Maine coastal town.

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

Hi Leeann,

I suggest you call your docs office and leave a message with the staff. Most docs will not mind returning the call especially when you have questions about meds/interactions etc. Another option would be to call your pharmacist. They will understand the medications too. As a last resort, try this free online drug interation checker: http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/druginterchecker

Remember, there are other sleep medications out there so you might find an alternative that you can take with Paxil. Also, keep in mind that antidepressant/antianxiety meds can take several weeks before you start to really benefit from them. Hopefully given enough time things will even out some and you'll be able to get some rest.

Here for you!

I'm a clean kid. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't have sex, I don't do drugs and I generally don't hang out with those who do. Where I'm from there aren't a lot of LGBT kids and but there is this one bi guy who is pretty cool. He was the one who I could talk about things with. He recently switched schools and I thought it would be good for him because he was in trouble at school and his home life was pretty rough and it would be good to get away from his sibs. (they still go to my school) He smokes, he drinks and he does drugs. He enjoys sex with anyone who will give it to him. Right after Christmas he overdosed. By some miracle he survived. I knew he was going to get into trouble but I didn't do anything. I didn't realize that he had hit rock bottom again. I've barely seen him this year and I can't believe this. I'm having trouble dealing with this. It scares me because I feel like I should have done something even though I haven't seen him and didn't know how bad things were. I've delt with a lot of shit this year and this is one I just don't know what to do about because I hate drugs and I don't approve of those who use them and I refuse to hang out with him if he's drunk or high and he's like my only friend who does drugs.

Probably not the best topic for Christmas, but I lost my baby sister to drugs on Tuesday. She had struggled for years with addictions. When she was straight she was a decent mom, who loved her kids. But sometimes the drugs were more important.
I'm mad at her, and the person who sold her the drugs. Whoever supplied her killed her. Period.
If any of those you love are involved with drugs in any way, get between them and the drugs in any way you can. I couldn't save my sister. Please try to save your loved one.

I am so incredibly sorry for your loss, Jan.

Death is never easy even in the best of circumstances.

We have been so busy with everything since my mom passed away on T-day this yr. I even last week forgot to pay all the bills. I found out when I tried to get online and had trouble so was trying to fix that all day with tech support. Next day phone was off, and cell phone, and gas bills were really late.So made me snap back into my routine. It is amazing how much time is envolved in taking care of everything when someone dies.

All that business though helped to keep the mind and body busy. So that was a blessing.

So very sorry about your sister. Your mom...she has lived thru alot. She is probably stronger than you realize. Try not to worry about her. She will be okay.

Wish there was something more I could say to help you thru this.

Love and Biggest Hugs!

I have been on and off of several drugs in the past few months. I'm currently on 150 mg of Lamictal and 5mg Abilify. I feel like im in a dream all the time - I'm spacy and I cant get anything done. I think the Lamictal is too high but my doc won't lower it. He just keeps throwing other drugs at me and they are expensive and don't work. I was on Geodon and I kept falling asleep. I am very sensitive to meds - just as an example, I was on 100 mg of Wellbutrin for ahwile and felt really hyper. I think many people can tolerate much more.

I think you should explain to your doc what you just explained to us at DS.
If he doesn't listen or you don't feel comfy enough to bring this up again with him/her then you maybe need to start looking for another doc that fits you better. Remember, they work for you, NOT the other way around.

I am on 150mg lamictal atm, working up to 200mg. It doesn't make me feel spacey at all, but we are all different. Anti-depressants like wellbutrin can make some of us manic, I can't take ADs at all. If you are feeling so icky, your doc needs to listen to what you are saying and what you want. My advice would be to google BP and the meds, and see if you can find out as much info as you can, and try and look at which meds you feel may be more helpful... none of us are docs I know, but it is our bodies and our lives being affected, I think being well informed is the best we can do. Good luck with it

Meds keep me functional. They also can take up to three months before they start working correctly. Keep taking your meds and after a while you will be totally used to them.

I currently take full dosage of 5 different meds. I also hold a job as some sort of slave. Hang in there.

I'm on the same dosage of Lamicatl but as someone else commented, we're all different. But I will say 'our' dosage of Lamictal isn't very high and I haven't heard of anyone feeling spacey from it. I have heard of issues some had with Wellbutrin (although I'm on that too without issue). However, Abilify made me want to jump out of my skin! - my pdoc said many experience issues with this and gave me Ativan to 'numb' any effects but I didn't want to be numb - I quit Abilify asap but again, that is me. Overall, I agree with the others, getting the right combo is crucial but having a pdoc who listens to you is just as crucial! If your pdoc won't listen, find another (even though I know it's a pain in the a**). Best of luck - I know it's tough and frustrating.

Rikkilyn, I take 400 mg of Lamictal every night. I don't feel like I am in a dream world.

I also took Abilify with the Lamictal for about a year. Didn't like the side effects of the Abilfy, but the side effect I didn't like wasn't at all what you are describing.

We are each so different. It really doesn't matter what experience I had with a particular drug combination. It only matters how your body responds to the drugs.We're all on the same path here. All looking for stability. I relly wish there was a magic pill or pill combination that works for everyone.

I am currently on 200mg, thinking about going up to 300. Lamictal has never made me feel strange except for the day I accidentaly took two doses, and it made me very stoned. I don't know about Abilify - I only took it a couple of days.

I had a psych that would just throw prescription after prescription at me, and it ended with a terrible experience with Lexapro that I have been recovering from for the last two and a half months. So I am much more cautious and found one that want me to fully research a med before he puts me on one.63

Hi, I am new on here. I thought I would try talking to other people outside of my family and friends. I lost my husband Jan. 29 of this year. He passed away due to cardiac arrest from an over dose of drugs. I was totally and compleltly unaware he was taking anything. It all has been such a huge shock. I was hoping to find some people that maybe would understand what I'm going throough.

My heart goes out to you in this time of your sorrow.
You are in the right place, it is what you need right now a compassionate listening ear and a shoulder to cry.
When the death is sudden it brings another set of issues to deal with while already in heart breaking agony grieving the loss.

I hope gradually you can find some comfort in your memories, and with the support of your family and friends, including your friends here, in DS site, your heart will start healing.
My husband too died suddenly , nothing prepared me for dealing with that tragedy. His death left many questions that I had to search for answers.,
I could not do it on my own, so I turned to my faith. I have been blessed with the support and kindness of many people to go through that time in my life.
I was seeking and luckily, I was finding all kinds of support groups, through church, mental health organizations, funeral home, non-profit organizations, and private therapy. I advise you do the same. We agonize the lose along, but we heal together.
Glad you are here. Stay with the DS, this site helped me through the toughest times. I am so eternally grateful.
Warmest hug,
Let the healing begin...

I lost my husband to a sudden heart attack on January 15. He wasn't sick at all. The shock was the first thing that hits . No this can't be true. No matter the reason for the heart attack the pain and shock is there. Then you start to second guess yourself, what did I miss. That part will drive you crazy if you let it. My first weeks were spent in all day crying and asking why. I found a support group that is really helping me to see that this grieve is normal and I'm not crazy. They had all been thru the different emotions at different times. It is a rough trip and I am sorry who have to travel it. Please come here often and share with us. Brenda

Thank you for all the kind words. I am here to talk to people that can maybe relate to my experience. There are two things that seem to bothering me the most. This first is that I didn't know...didn't see. The second is...I feel like everything from the very beginning was a lie. His family knew and they all, including him, knew my thoughts on drugs. I didn't want around them, let alone in my home. They were EVERYWHERE. I thank God my mom was able to be there with me. The cops, paramedics, and coroner actually stopped talking to me because they just kept throwing things at me that I no idea on....I coudn't handle any more and she stepped in and took control.

My husband was taking an anti-depressant medication that was not Rx'd to him, but *sampled* to him by his physician. Because of HIPPA law, I was not entitled to know or be made aware of- even though the first 9 days are critical &quot;watch&quot; days. He was on his third day of anti-depressant medication, but several pills were gone from the package. Other substances were consumed which ultimately lead to his death.

I felt so responsible because I was his wife- I should've known and helped him. I should've cared enough to find out and be aware (I called it respecting his space...but really- according to the Holy Scriptures- as his wife I owned him...likewise as my husband he owned me) I felt betrayed and violated all at once with his death and the circumstances thereof.

I remind myself all the time, this was not my fault. I couldn't have stopped him but for maybe a short time and even then it would be constant emotional blackmail to control me and garner my attention. Rather, I try to comfort myself with the knowledge that he is with our Lord Jesus Christ (he confessed Jesus as his Lord and Savior) in perfect peace, released from his internal mental hell.

Hope that helps.64

Found out, for sure, that my youngest son, 15 years old, Todd is involved in drugs. We know he is definitely smoking pot and rumors say he is doing acid and ecstasy. We (my husband & I ) bought a home testing kit yesterday, and surprisingly, he "didn't have to go". When he finally did, we gave him the cup and he "misunderstood" how to do it....(I won't bother with details).

Anyway, does anyone know how long drugs (other than pot) stay in a person's system? I really could have used this information because I was going to call someone to get information on how to get him assessed.

Also -- does anyone know if a person can be on something without anyone knowing? My son came home the other night and seemed fine. He was coherent and "seemed" fine. We received a call just before he came home from a mom that he and a bunch of kids were partying at her home without permission. She said she was told that my son supplied some of the beer. He had no alcohol on his breath either.

I call him slippery Todd. I know he's doing something, other than pot, but even with that...I don't see any physical signs he's using.

Hi mother of Todd.
I know that pot can stay in your system up to 6 months.It all depends on how much is inhale and how often smoked. Ectasy stays in your system for 3 days. The home kits are excellent especially for the convenience. It would be nice if he could watch a documentary on what drugs does to people lives and their bodies.

I am ashamed to admit I would have been slippery Mic. I knew how to cover up smells and pull myself together until my mom never knew what I was on. We would wash our hands because the joint would leave its smell on our fingers. Smell his coat and fingers but he will soon figure that out. I was in a drug free work place training today and how long drugs stay in you system is dependent on the individual. Pot last the longest. I can only tell you I was an unhappy 30 year old when I stopped using drugs. I am also a tired 46 year old finally finishing college. I wish someone would have beat some sense in me the day after I started. He will be beyond reason because the drugs are ruling him. Get professional help keep testing. He may hate you now but later he will apreiciate it. Don't enable him and trust is unpredictable. The drugs could become the greatest love in his live. Be strong.

Does anyone know what is involved in an assessment for drugs? I friend of mine is a local drug counselor in another school system and she suggested that my son get one. She explained that the assessment is a very long questionaire. I didn't think to ask her if he tests that he is addicted and it comes out that he is doing other drugs, what the next step is. I know I can find out myself when I make the call later, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having their teen tested. Thanks.

Just had my 15 YO son tested for pot, ecstasy, etc. WE did urine and hair at a private lab. $65 for hair. We were shocked that he passed. So were some of his friends. One told me he does smoke tobacco and another told me he smoked pot with him. When the friends are worried, I am terrified. But he passsed. He is extremely thin. My hubby says it is the body fat and that any test can be passed. he also rejects church....

So I'm a teenager, around Todd's age
I have no idea if your son is using other drugs without anyone knowing, but I'd like to tell you right now:
DO NOT TRUST OTHER PARENTS
I have no idea what your sons image is, but if he dresses punk, emo, goth, skater, etc, he will be judged. Trust me on that.
I'm not saying don't trust all parents. I'm saying keep your eyes open and remember that some are gonna judge and base their decisions on looks or a reputation...if your son did not have beer on his breath but the other kids mom said he supplied the beer, who should you believe? I don't know this mom, but she could be judging his looks or rep.

As for your son doing these drugs, I'd like to say that there should be consequences for this, but don't go completely behind his back
Something is wrong if he is doing this
Let him know he can talk to you, and if you think he's too uncomfortable, get an adult you think he is very comfortable with
And if nothing works at all, maybe therapy would...just try talking to him

good luck

i feel for you - we are damned if we know and damned if we don't. I think it is very important to call around some local testing sites for back-up to the home tests. Most will try everything to beat whatever - wherever the test is. Keep testing though. Maybe at some point, he will understand he is going to be held responsible for his actions (isn't this what we are all waiting for our teens to get?)
Comment(s):
deleted_user 9 years ago
Yes, your teen can be doing drugs and you are none the wiser until testing.

Consider asking him where the beer come from; another parent, an older contact, soliciting out in front of a store? If it is from an older friend, you might let him know that if you chose to you could press charges for supplying alcohol to a minor.... no kid wants to put their &quot;friend&quot; on the hook. Also, the friend may think that alcohol is not a big deal......but in this case - with the other drugs it is.

Yes pot stays in the system for a while. I don't believe that acid shows up in drug screening -- could be wrong. Ecstasy for just a short time. The kids really like the sensory of ecstasy experience but the new brain research shows that ecstasy has some long term effects on the brain; these are showing up as significant memory deficits at middle age.....you might share this fact with him. Further, this research is from the aging literature and not the anti-drug and so your son might consider the source a little more valid.....

My kids got sick of me saying that I did everything for healthy brain development during pregnancy and was going to see it through their teen years since the brain is still developing (they can actually see time lapsed imaging of the teen brain pruning synapses...very cool stuff!)

The questionnaires should only be given by people licensed to give, interpret and share the result. Also, tests are a dime a dozen, so be sure that it is the most appropriate diagnostic tool. Be sure to understand what the test can and CANNOT do. Consider asking your counselor/doctor/psychiatrist about any recommendations.

Finally, it is interesting to me that he is using drugs that have a lot of sensory attributes.....is this filling a neurological need, or social (boredom, fitting in and using the drug de jour) or escaping because of personal stress/depression????? He may not know and once again, here's hoping you find a good counselor.

This is a tough time - hang in there!

This is such an unsettling time for you and your family and my prayers go out to you. Do you (or Todd's father) have a decent relationship with him? Do you talk? Is he involved in sports? Cars/bikes? Do you know his friends by first name? How about his comings and goings? Are you aware of where he is and who he is with? I ask you this because this will help you both with this situation.
The tell-tale signs of the drugs vary with drug type and volume of use. Pot stays in your system the longest but can be flushed enough (with water and frequent urination) in order to pass the drug test. Other signs of pot use is the obvious; the smell, blood-shot eyes, sluggishness, increased appetite (the munchies), apathy. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior- sleeping more or less, different choice of music, different group of friends, loss of interest in usual activities, secretiveness. Most hallucinegenic drugs such as acid and ecstacy will give way to visual changes; fixation on lights and spinning objects. His pupils will most likely be large and dilated. These drugs are very sensory oriented- sight, sound, and touch are heightened. Acid and ex are very dangerous (all of them are for that matter) as most of these are synthetic and are therefor a mixture that can be lethal. You never know what you are taking or how your body will respond- it's like playing russian roulette. I do know that your personal psychological state at the time directly impacts the &quot;high&quot;. I knew someone in high school who was very stressed and he &quot;dropped&quot; some acid and had a bad &quot;trip&quot;- he has never been the same- it permanently affected his psyche- in otherwords, he went out of his mind! Teens these days are also into prescription drugs (percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, ritalin, adderal, etc.) They will also use inhalants (aerosol spray cans).
If you feel in your gut that there is a problem, seek help. I haven't checked out the support groups on this web site but there are groups in the community that can help. It's tough because of the teenage denial thing. At this point it's a matter of life and death!
My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

Thanks for all your support. I can't believe it's August and we are still at the tip of the iceberg with this drug thing. My husband and I have had Todd tested both in and outside a lab and some were negative and some positive. We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.67

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

Hi Leeann,

I suggest you call your docs office and leave a message with the staff. Most docs will not mind returning the call especially when you have questions about meds/interactions etc. Another option would be to call your pharmacist. They will understand the medications too. As a last resort, try this free online drug interation checker: http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/druginterchecker

Remember, there are other sleep medications out there so you might find an alternative that you can take with Paxil. Also, keep in mind that antidepressant/antianxiety meds can take several weeks before you start to really benefit from them. Hopefully given enough time things will even out some and you'll be able to get some rest.

Here for you!

We (my husband and I) have briefly been through this with our 15 yr. old son....smoking pot. We thought (or hoped) he was finished with this nonsense. We weren't naive. We thought he could still be dabbling (and perhaps he still is) but we weren't sure. After midnight our doorbell rang. It was a police officer. Great. He found a backpack in the park with my son's prescription for pain (he broke his nose) along with a pot pipe. He seemed "clean" but we told the police officer that we would take him to the doctor's to get him drug tested. My son swears he's clean. The pipe belongs to one of his friends that he doesn't want to reveal (or so he says). Regardless, he still had it in his possession. I don't know if he is clean if the officer will still press charges. This is so upsetting. If charges are pressed his name will be mud at the high school. The school is informed. He will lose soccer playing time ....something he needs desperately. I am not minimizing the fact he's may be doing something but all the garbage that goes along with it....is going to stink. I am waiting to hear from the doctor to get an order so we can get him tested. The home kit doesn't work for us. In the past he conveniently messed it up. It's going to be a long summer...........

The kits work...but my son has had a &quot;scattered&quot; brain moment in the past and didn't do the test &quot;correctly&quot;....very conveniently. The last time we tried to have him tested at home (months ago) he messed up the test &quot;by mistake&quot;, handing over a substance that didn't come from him, if you know what I mean. So this time I wanted a guaranteed test. He still claims he is clean. He actually insisted on going to have the test done. I don't know....we will see. If he's clean I don't know if he will be charged (he's almost 16)for possession. I think it would be obvious it isn't his if clean. I don't know what to expect.

As far as losing soccer playing time...I didn't ask him. Honestly, I think it will bother him some but he won't be devastated....I don't think... It certainly will bother his parents...he needs the sport. Thanks Chrissy!

Hopefully he is clean the pipe really is his friend's. But I remember when I was 17 and my mother found my over the counter birth control in my purse... that belonged to my &quot;friend&quot;. Oh, and so did the cigarettes they found a few months before that. Good to do the test.

It's a long wait when having to get results from a lab. I guess the lab ships the samples to another lab where they actually to the testing. They said it will take about 24 hours. In the meantime, he's been great about the grounding. He hasn't been bugging me to be &quot;released&quot;. And it's great having him around. He actually spent some time with his oldest brother yesterday. Maybe he's relieved that he was caught? Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised. I so hope I am. He seems very confident...so we will see. Whether he's drug free or not, we need to have some stronger ground rules because I don't like him spending so much time away from home....it only invites trouble. **I know to be suspicous about the &quot;friend&quot; excuse...I was young once!

Well, going through the diversion program will most likely help him realize that smoking pot is not the way to go. And once he endures the consequences brought on him when the school and his coach find out he will hopefully conclude that it &quot;just isn't worth it&quot; and will be done with drugs.
Comment(s):

I am not sure why anybody will know since he is 15 and all juvenile court matters are confidential. The school will know if part of his probation causes him to miss class (excuse from the courts).

If it helps to know you are not alone in this stage, age 15 was the year that ours got caught at home with pot and by the police with alcohol. We did the drug testing on our own and made him go to counseling. The counseling turned out to be very helpful to him (peer and anxiety issues dealt with). The court diversion program was a positive experience experience; the kids with pot had a tougher road to hoe.....

For us there were several motivators --- First, it's hell to live at home and not be trusted and he worked hard to regain our trust. Two, he wanted to work and drug testing is a part of the application process. Third, he wanted to drive and any substance abuse would have meant we would yank his license. He worked hard to change the nature of his activities and friendships.....we also applied pressure and kept tabs on cell phone call numbers, checked facebook friends and so on. Late nights out and extended time away from home had to be earned......It was a difficult time for all of us.

If soccer is the motivating event in your son's life, perhaps the coach will let him play as long as he tests clean? Perhaps the court will intervene and ask the coach to let him play as a privilege during probation (along with keeping grades up,etc). Is there a different league that is not school based that he could be a part of? Soccer is so big here that the leagues tend to be more competitive than what the school has to offer.

For us, 15 was a turning point - it could have gone either way....Teens do things that make us mad and embarrass us as parents -- the only comforting thought is that nearly every parent is faced with something similar. Hope you and your husband are on the same page in terms of how to handle this. Good Luck!

Thank you for your input. I know we are not alone in this and it's comforting to know we can get advice from those who have been there. As far as getting caught by the police...unfortunately this is no confidentiality between them and the school. The school is notified so that they can be part of the consequences... even if it doesn't take place on school property. Taking sports away, to me, doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. These are the kids who really need it. My son will lose some playing time because it's his first offense. He actually may lose more because he'll be off for six weeks recovering from surgery for a broken nose. The timing of handing down consequences coincides with his surgery recovery. As of now, he doesn't know we know the testing results, yet. Since he was worried about the surgery and recovery, we didn't want to add to his troubles. My husband and I now have time to contemplate how or what we are going to do. We haven't called the police with the results, yet, nor have they called us.

just as a kid who has been in your son's position...I'll tell you what the kids know and not many parents know...diversion program=introduction to harder drugs...and only makes you want pot more. oh, and if he insists you drugs test him because he's &quot;clean&quot;...he's probably not. That's what I always said to my parents and since I told them to drug test me they thought I must be clean...so they never tested me.

I agree with you in thinking that they shouldn't take soccer away! if they take it away then he has more time to mess around and do drugs! I wish the school would see things like that!! I got my sports &quot;taken&quot; away from me, and that's when i got into pot, drinking, pills, and other stuff..so I think from personal experience that taking sports away only makes things WORSE!

good luck with everything though...I know a bit too much about the juvenile drug world...

CALL A LAWYER TRUST ME! Been there done that. Call a lawyer a very good lawyer and let them tell you what to do. I hope I am not too late in telling you this. I see how outdated this topic is.
You like me what to protect your son, spend the money on a lawyer to deal with it and advise you. In the mean time get him counseling NOW. Trust me, something is going on with him. I called the lawyer thank god, but I didn't get the counseling and now I have a suicidal son. The guilt for him and the lies etc. are too much. Please get help for your son.71

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

I have been on and off of several drugs in the past few months. I'm currently on 150 mg of Lamictal and 5mg Abilify. I feel like im in a dream all the time - I'm spacy and I cant get anything done. I think the Lamictal is too high but my doc won't lower it. He just keeps throwing other drugs at me and they are expensive and don't work. I was on Geodon and I kept falling asleep. I am very sensitive to meds - just as an example, I was on 100 mg of Wellbutrin for ahwile and felt really hyper. I think many people can tolerate much more.

I think you should explain to your doc what you just explained to us at DS.
If he doesn't listen or you don't feel comfy enough to bring this up again with him/her then you maybe need to start looking for another doc that fits you better. Remember, they work for you, NOT the other way around.
Best of luck to you Sweetie.

I am on 150mg lamictal atm, working up to 200mg. It doesn't make me feel spacey at all, but we are all different. Anti-depressants like wellbutrin can make some of us manic, I can't take ADs at all. If you are feeling so icky, your doc needs to listen to what you are saying and what you want. My advice would be to google BP and the meds, and see if you can find out as much info as you can, and try and look at which meds you feel may be more helpful... none of us are docs I know, but it is our bodies and our lives being affected, I think being well informed is the best we can do. Good luck with it

I'm on the same dosage of Lamicatl but as someone else commented, we're all different. But I will say 'our' dosage of Lamictal isn't very high and I haven't heard of anyone feeling spacey from it. I have heard of issues some had with Wellbutrin (although I'm on that too without issue). However, Abilify made me want to jump out of my skin! - my pdoc said many experience issues with this and gave me Ativan to 'numb' any effects but I didn't want to be numb - I quit Abilify asap but again, that is me. Overall, I agree with the others, getting the right combo is crucial but having a pdoc who listens to you is just as crucial! If your pdoc won't listen, find another (even though I know it's a pain in the a**). Best of luck - I know it's tough and frustrating.

Rikkilyn, I take 400 mg of Lamictal every night. I don't feel like I am in a dream world.

I also took Abilify with the Lamictal for about a year. Didn't like the side effects of the Abilfy, but the side effect I didn't like wasn't at all what you are describing.

We are each so different. It really doesn't matter what experience I had with a particular drug combination. It only matters how your body responds to the drugs.We're all on the same path here. All looking for stability. I relly wish there was a magic pill or pill combination that works for everyone.

I am currently on 200mg, thinking about going up to 300. Lamictal has never made me feel strange except for the day I accidentaly took two doses, and it made me very stoned. I don't know about Abilify - I only took it a couple of days.

I had a psych that would just throw prescription after prescription at me, and it ended with a terrible experience with Lexapro that I have been recovering from for the last two and a half months. So I am much more cautious and found one that want me to fully research a med before he puts me on one.73

How does everyone manage to function?

I barely can. I take 15 mg Oxycodone every 8 hours for pain (I hurt all the time but if I can keep the level at 4, I feel like I'm olay). I also have 2 mg Dilaudid for when the pain can't be controlled with the Oxy. It used to be that I had to go to the ER for pain management. Now, with the home Dilaudid, I can keep those visits to a minimum.

I feel "disconnected" much of the time. My concentration is scattered and I feel like I want to sleep all the time. I have no energy and you can imagine what these painkillers have done to my bowels. I also feel kind of down in the dumps...I never realized how hard CP and chronic pain would be to handle.

I'm totally with you. I've had to go on disability after years because of the pain and also the side effects of the drugs. I take much more Oxy (2-3 15mg tablets every 4 hours) and have 150mcg Fentanyl patches. And they don't really even cut the pain anymore. I live at an 8. Maybe a different pain med would work better for you? I found Phenergan spacey at first but now it doesn't affect me. Same with Klonopin. Your body does adjust.

I think you have to go thro a grieving process and let your old life go (the before CP). I'm still in that phase. But there are times I can let the what if's go and just try to settle into enjoying what I have.

And lean hard on your friends here whenever you need to! Take care, Nibs74

Let me start by saying I have nothing against people taking anti depressants. What I do have a problem with is how quickly gps are handing them out. there is a dr here, and every single one of my friends that went to him where given anti depressants. one went in with a broken arm and left with them.

I know drs are a little in the dark about mental illness and sexual disease, but isn't ot time they learn a little something? how about they stop reaching for the anti depressant right away and start refering people and recomending some lifestyle changes.

How ironic that my GP just offered to prescribe anti-depressants for me this morning. I have told him I will think about it and I have just put a posting on the Depression Support Group hoping for some sensible opinions.

To be fair to my GP, he did say that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is probably better but that psychologists/psychiatrists are not always available when we need them.

The reality is that we all need to cope with what life throws at us. We don&#039;t have to take anti-depressants; it should be an informed decision.

Mummy, are you saying you were prescribed anti-depressants when you were only 15?

Its a simple solution for GPs. Rather than tie up a greater amount of funds in CBT they give pills. Its a culture thats been present since victorian quacks, Pills are seen as the big problem solver by health authorities.
If you get given Anti-depressants and show signs of improvement after a couple of months they can put you down as successfully treated, makes em look real good to their superiors.
Remember, Doctors are never wrong and all like to kiss ass, anyway they can make their reputation grow, theyll use.

bad idea! anti-depressants can have serious side effects which include making people suicidal in certain cases. because of that and the fact that they&#039;re useless for situational depression, they&#039;re only supposed to be used for clinical depression.

like every other sector of society, there are good and bad GPs and any good GP would not prescribe psychiatric medication. if they suspect someone of having a psychiatric problem, the right course of action would be to refer them to a specialist - a psychiatrist in this case. i&#039;d be just as weary of a GP that prescribes anti-depressants as i would of one that tried to sell me glasses to improve my eyesight!

I think their are so many inconsistancies in mental health. GPs should be given guidlines to follow. Where to refer people to ect. Instead of trying to fix a problem in a field they know nothing about. As you pointed out the side effects can be deadly. And I certainly do not believe gps should be giving any sort of psychiatric drugs to teenagers. From 11 to 18 your brain is developing not only in thought but physically as well.It is such a vital and delicate phase of brain development no body that isn&#039;t trained in that field should be touching it. I guess this post has no point and i am just bringing up the same argument again.

The post DOES have a point - it is giving us the opportunity to discuss the use of prescribed drugs/pharmaceuticals in our Western cultures. A pill for all ills! Your point about the large pharmaceutical companies making large profits is also worthy of investigation.

To be fair to our doctors though, some people go expecting the magic pill to make them feel better. I have a friend who is a GP and she is certainly very much against over-prescribing. She has been known to give out a &#039;poem prescription&#039;!77

Do you think your doctor would order a blood workup that would show if you're lacking in any vitamins? You could be deficient in Iron, or Vitamin D, or Vitamin C any one of which could have you feeling fatigued if you were low on it. And probably lots of other ones.

I didnt read your link but we know or I know all drugs have side effects.
Everything goes through our liver and causes problems also. Even our diet of fatty food or drinking alcohol harms our liver.

Its a catch 22, damned if we do and damned if we dont. I stay away from pain meds unless I feel like I have no choice. I never take tylenol because it inflamed my liver once. I also dont use nsids because they thin my blood.

Each person is an individual and its up to each person to choose wht they think best for their life.

It is probably true that most drugs do not &quot;cure&quot; fibromyalgia, or for that matter, many other disease or illness. I am sure that some illnesses are more easily treated and can take away so many of the open symptoms, that it appears to have cured the problem. But perhaps, later on, the body suffers side effects, of new illnesses from the &quot;cure&quot; for the original one. It is very difficult to work with this problem. I myself need pain relief. But I do not fool myself into believing this is a cure. In fact, I am doing everything I can, reasearching every known article and treatment, trying to find a so called cure so that I will no longer suffer the terrible pain that can only be relieved with painkillers. Others on this board have had &quot;new&quot; breakthroughs&quot; in at least potential areas that could be leading to their fibro symptoms, and I am encouraged by some of the things I am reading about: systemic enzymes, bio-identical hormones (particularly pregnenolone), among other areas. I am sure that in my case, as I have been suffering for YEARS, that the effects of acupuncture might be just what I need to Kick-start my circulation and balance my organs and glands sufficiantly to enable me to rid myself of some of my symptoms along with enable myself to better handle the rest.

I think if they drugs made drugs that cured us the profit margin would be considerably less. I am not a conspiracy theorist however I do think they look at staying in business in the long run. I hear people all the time who say they have the cure for cancer. And I am sure there are actually people who honestly believe this. I asked a doctor the same question. His answer, most drugs are designed to provide immediate relief of a given symptom. Well I guess that supports my theory. Thats my take on it. I also like the thoughts of others on this issue. There is much truth to it all even if my thoughts are deabteable. Good day take care. Dave. aka flyboy57

My daughter has a seizure disorder. when she was young the doctors put her on meds. the more meds they gave her the more seizures she would have. It got into a bad cycle I ask the doctor if it was related that the more meds she took the more seizures she would have. He said No and wrote her another script. she was on 3 meds adult doses of each. She lost weight and got really sick they said we have to lower her dose off one of these meds it toxic in her system. She started to act and look better so behind the doctors back we weened her off one med and no seizures. I took her to the doctor and he was mad and said you did what? then he said the next seizure we are going to add another med.
So I weened her off another med and no seizures
He was furrious with me. I said but she hasn't had a seizure. He did not care all he cared about was that I was doing what I thouight was right.
To make a long story short I took her off all her meds and she never had a seizure again. The doctor did not want to deal with us again. He said why are you coming to see me when you don't listen. I said I'm not blaming you why dont u use this as a learning lesson. And we never spoke again.
this is why I'm scared to take drugs!80

If you mean that you feel 'out of it', that sounds like disassociation from extreme stress. It's normal for the human body to find ways to cope, and that's how it's doing it. It 'removing' you from the situation.

Seeing that things seem to be getting worse it could be Bipolar Disorder. Have you done anything real erratic that you wouldn't normally do or spent a large amount of money on one purchase or what you did purchase hide it from others?82

I have been on and off of several drugs in the past few months. I'm currently on 150 mg of Lamictal and 5mg Abilify. I feel like im in a dream all the time - I'm spacy and I cant get anything done. I think the Lamictal is too high but my doc won't lower it. He just keeps throwing other drugs at me and they are expensive and don't work. I was on Geodon and I kept falling asleep. I am very sensitive to meds - just as an example, I was on 100 mg of Wellbutrin for ahwile and felt really hyper. I think many people can tolerate much more.

I think you should explain to your doc what you just explained to us at DS.
If he doesn't listen or you don't feel comfy enough to bring this up again with him/her then you maybe need to start looking for another doc that fits you better. Remember, they work for you, NOT the other way around.
Best of luck to you Sweetie.

I am on 150mg lamictal atm, working up to 200mg. It doesn't make me feel spacey at all, but we are all different. Anti-depressants like wellbutrin can make some of us manic, I can't take ADs at all. If you are feeling so icky, your doc needs to listen to what you are saying and what you want. My advice would be to google BP and the meds, and see if you can find out as much info as you can, and try and look at which meds you feel may be more helpful... none of us are docs I know, but it is our bodies and our lives being affected, I think being well informed is the best we can do. Good luck with it

Meds keep me functional. They also can take up to three months before they start working correctly. Keep taking your meds and after a while you will be totally used to them.

I currently take full dosage of 5 different meds. I also hold a job as some sort of slave. Hang in there.

I'm on the same dosage of Lamicatl but as someone else commented, we're all different. But I will say 'our' dosage of Lamictal isn't very high and I haven't heard of anyone feeling spacey from it. I have heard of issues some had with Wellbutrin (although I'm on that too without issue). However, Abilify made me want to jump out of my skin! - my pdoc said many experience issues with this and gave me Ativan to 'numb' any effects but I didn't want to be numb - I quit Abilify asap but again, that is me. Overall, I agree with the others, getting the right combo is crucial but having a pdoc who listens to you is just as crucial! If your pdoc won't listen, find another (even though I know it's a pain in the a**). Best of luck - I know it's tough and frustrating.

Rikkilyn, I take 400 mg of Lamictal every night. I don't feel like I am in a dream world.

I also took Abilify with the Lamictal for about a year. Didn't like the side effects of the Abilfy, but the side effect I didn't like wasn't at all what you are describing.

We are each so different. It really doesn't matter what experience I had with a particular drug combination. It only matters how your body responds to the drugs.We're all on the same path here. All looking for stability. I relly wish there was a magic pill or pill combination that works for everyone.

I am currently on 200mg, thinking about going up to 300. Lamictal has never made me feel strange except for the day I accidentaly took two doses, and it made me very stoned. I don't know about Abilify - I only took it a couple of days.

I had a psych that would just throw prescription after prescription at me, and it ended with a terrible experience with Lexapro that I have been recovering from for the last two and a half months. So I am much more cautious and found one that want me to fully research a med before he puts me on one.83

My boyfriend is out of town.... I went for a girls night Friday with a friend to a local bar. One of my boyfriend's friends was there.... and when my girl friend met a guy and decided to go home with him.... I got a ride from my boyfriend's friend.... I had no reason to feel suspicious. We got back to my apartment, he asked if he could come in and hang out for a minute, didn't think anything wrong with it. I had one more drink... didn't even finish the drink.... last thing I remember is telling him that I was tired... then I woke up drenched in sweat, urinated on myself, throwing up, shaking, and feeling awful. I didn't have enough to drink to be hungover and this was different. I couldn't remember anything from the night before... I don't know if anything happened... I don't know what happened.... and I am so scared to tell my boyfriend.... I am so scared to be alone.... I can't stop crying.

If you have a strong relationship with your partner then you should most definitely tells him. Right now you are afraid and alone and your fear is closing you off. These fears are hurting you and ripping holes into you and the wounds will fester and get worse.

I recently forced myself to open up and talk to my partner. We have been together 5 years but I never talked in detail about my past just that I was abused and life was bad. But the past started haunting my dreams and I was remembering things I hadn't thought about in years and questioning things I wasnt mature enough to question.

I let my fears get to me so badly. I stopped wanting a sexual relationship with my partner. I began avoiding touches. I couldn't sleep. I cried all the time. I tried to help myself but I couldn't. One day it finally got so bad that I wouldn't allow my partner to touch me and even didn't want my four year old daughter to touch me. I was just crying but didn't want to talk.

Finally I wrote a letter trying to explain. He came home to find me sobbing all over the notebook. I opened up and I have felt a million times better since that day. I let the fear paralyze me and stop me from connecting to the two most important people in my life. The very same people I need most in my corner while I'm fighting my demons. Don't let the same happen to you. Talk to your partner and figure out how you feel.

Are you sure you were raped or are you afraid because you were drugged? Could someone have slipped something into your drink at the bar before you left? If your boyfriends friends are this shady he needs to know who he has been keeping company with.

Tell your boyfriend or have him read your post. It is obvious that his friend drugged you and he drugged you for a purpose -sexual assault- otherwise why bother. It happened to me and I too doubted because whatever happened while you were drugged does not exist for you because there is no memory. Exactly the same thing 2nd glass of wine and then it was the next morning and it felt different. You can read my experience at www.surviverape.blogspot.com if you like.
Remember that you are the victim in this!

That's a horrible thing to have happen to you. For me, not knowing is worse than having bad memories.

It would prob. be a good idea to see a doctor. I don't know what he gave you but traces of some drugs can stay in your system for a long time.

Hopefully you were not assaulted.

You'll have to be strong and even be ready for it if your mind starts to piece together what happened and it's bad.

I've heard of cases where people were drugged and later start to remember bits and pieces of what happened.84

Do you all think that once we've been diagnosed with PM , should we always be on an immunosuppressant drug ? I've only done steroids and then stopped when I could function again. NOW I only do NUEROTIN to cover up symptoms, and other things for PAIN but thats all??? Do we all just wait to get REAL BAD again or go on immunosuppressants BEFORE WE aren't able to get off the couch at all ???

I know when I started this adventure, I was pretty bad off. I was scared of Prednisone but it was necessary. I thought I would only be on it for a year or so but as we tried to taper, my symptoms came back. So I was given Methotrexate as a replacement for the Prednisone. It will be 4 years in June that I've been on Prednisone and 3 years since I started Methotrexate. I have begun to wonder if I will ever get off Prednisone. My Neurologist said it is doubtful because I've shown my symptoms will just come back.

I know for me, I can't go back to where I was when it all started. I've come to terms with the fact I will always be on medication to keep the disease in check. I do so want off Prednisone. I'm hoping next week I am able to drop to 5mg instead of 7.5 mg.

I think if your disease truly goes into remission without medication and you can handle the pain and other issues, more power to you. I would love to get there.

Hey Boo,
I am in the same boat as you. I am tapering off of the prednisone as we speak. 5 one day now 2 starting today. I a little scared as to how I feel about this process. I just broke up with my BF and of course the strain is killing me. I take supplements prescribed from the doctor to boost my immune system. That's it. Try and eat right. Include figs when I can ect. Think of boosting your immune system on your own. I think we all have the ability to do this.
Hang in there. Would love to share blood work to see if we are the same however. Because clearly, others are much worse off.

If you're lucky enough to manage without drugs - lucky you! I am taking Cellcept and dosing down on Prednisone and am experiencing weakness, pain and loss of balance just from the change-up. Clearly I cannot function without drugs. Before I took them I was barely able to walk around by myself.

I think that when ever possible it is best not to be on the prednisone, from what my doctor has told me, the less I am on it the better. I do admit that when i was on it I felt better, but I would rather be without. just keep a positive attitude and things will get better. I have found that eating healthy helps in many ways.

I guess i was misleading ! I take Gabapentin and Tramadol . without the gabapentin I can't walk around either, I was just wondering if I was letting myself get worse by not doing Immunosuppresants. I believe Gabapentin blocks the sensors from the brain to the pain, and it works because I forgot it on a trip one time and couldn.t get more till the following Monday and I was so bad!! didn,t realize how much it was helping .its safer than steroids!

So you find gabapentine helps for your nerve pain? I've tried amitryptaline and now Lyrica. The first did nothing, the second just seems to be making me fat... I think gabapentine is the next try. However, that's just for the nerve pain (which doesn't stop me from doing anything). Without the prednisone and the cellcept I would be hooped.

I am no expert but I was told that it is important to save the nerves. Once they die, they never come back. They can re-route but a dead nerve is permanently dead. So I believe it is important to keep the disease under control. What that means is between you and the doctor. For me, it means Prednisone and Methotrexate.

My goal (and my docs') is to get off predisone as soom as possible, due to the multiple and serious long-term side effects.

The typical strategy is to start another prednisone-sparing immunosuppressant such as mtx, imuran, cellcept, etc. Since these drugs take awhile to be fully effective, most of us to stay on the high dose of prednisone for a a few months, then slowly taper down as the other immunosuppressant starts to become effective. How long you'll stay on the immunosuppressant is probably a very individual decision based on your history of flares along the way.

Five years into this thing, I still haven't been able to get off prednisone because I can't tolerate the other immunosuppressants. I was really hopeful that my last Rituxan treatment would allow me to taper from 10-0mg, but no such luck. I had a terrible skin reaction to the Rituxan, which had to be treated with high dose prednisone :( And now 6 months after Rituxan, I'm just now back to down to where I started at 10mg of prednisone.

Not losing sight of my goal, though...

If you're really worried about taking immunosuppressants, but you and your doc feel you need some sort of disease controlling medication, you might (might!) be able to get on the IVIg. It's pretty much the exact opposite of immunosuppressant - you're actually receiving additional immune cells from plasma donors. Instead of suppressing your immune system, it will be incredibly boosted - especially at the relatively high dosages used for DM. (The dose for DM is about four times what I get to bring my nonexistant immune system up to normal.)

The biggest difficulty in getting IVIg would probably be your insurance company. It's extremely expensive - my dosage costs Blue Cross about 3k/month. So you have to get prior approval. My insurance at least, approves a set number of infusions and then when those have been exhausted, the medicos have to get a new approval.

Just a thought.86

Found out, for sure, that my youngest son, 15 years old, Todd is involved in drugs. We know he is definitely smoking pot and rumors say he is doing acid and ecstasy. We (my husband & I ) bought a home testing kit yesterday, and surprisingly, he "didn't have to go". When he finally did, we gave him the cup and he "misunderstood" how to do it....(I won't bother with details).

Anyway, does anyone know how long drugs (other than pot) stay in a person's system? I really could have used this information because I was going to call someone to get information on how to get him assessed.

Also -- does anyone know if a person can be on something without anyone knowing? My son came home the other night and seemed fine. He was coherent and "seemed" fine. We received a call just before he came home from a mom that he and a bunch of kids were partying at her home without permission. She said she was told that my son supplied some of the beer. He had no alcohol on his breath either.

I call him slippery Todd. I know he's doing something, other than pot, but even with that...I don't see any physical signs he's using.

Hi mother of Todd.
I know that pot can stay in your system up to 6 months.It all depends on how much is inhale and how often smoked. Ectasy stays in your system for 3 days. The home kits are excellent especially for the convenience. It would be nice if he could watch a documentary on what drugs does to people lives and their bodies.

I am ashamed to admit I would have been slippery Mic. I knew how to cover up smells and pull myself together until my mom never knew what I was on. We would wash our hands because the joint would leave its smell on our fingers. Smell his coat and fingers but he will soon figure that out. I was in a drug free work place training today and how long drugs stay in you system is dependent on the individual. Pot last the longest. I can only tell you I was an unhappy 30 year old when I stopped using drugs. I am also a tired 46 year old finally finishing college. I wish someone would have beat some sense in me the day after I started. He will be beyond reason because the drugs are ruling him. Get professional help keep testing. He may hate you now but later he will apreiciate it. Don't enable him and trust is unpredictable. The drugs could become the greatest love in his live. Be strong.

Does anyone know what is involved in an assessment for drugs? I friend of mine is a local drug counselor in another school system and she suggested that my son get one. She explained that the assessment is a very long questionaire. I didn't think to ask her if he tests that he is addicted and it comes out that he is doing other drugs, what the next step is. I know I can find out myself when I make the call later, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having their teen tested. Thanks.

So I'm a teenager, around Todd's age
I have no idea if your son is using other drugs without anyone knowing, but I'd like to tell you right now:
DO NOT TRUST OTHER PARENTS
I have no idea what your sons image is, but if he dresses punk, emo, goth, skater, etc, he will be judged. Trust me on that.
I'm not saying don't trust all parents. I'm saying keep your eyes open and remember that some are gonna judge and base their decisions on looks or a reputation...if your son did not have beer on his breath but the other kids mom said he supplied the beer, who should you believe? I don't know this mom, but she could be judging his looks or rep.

As for your son doing these drugs, I'd like to say that there should be consequences for this, but don't go completely behind his back
Something is wrong if he is doing this
Let him know he can talk to you, and if you think he's too uncomfortable, get an adult you think he is very comfortable with
And if nothing works at all, maybe therapy would...just try talking to him

good luck

i feel for you - we are damned if we know and damned if we don't. I think it is very important to call around some local testing sites for back-up to the home tests. Most will try everything to beat whatever - wherever the test is. Keep testing though. Maybe at some point, he will understand he is going to be held responsible for his actions (isn't this what we are all waiting for our teens to get?)
Comment(s):

Yes, your teen can be doing drugs and you are none the wiser until testing.

Consider asking him where the beer come from; another parent, an older contact, soliciting out in front of a store? If it is from an older friend, you might let him know that if you chose to you could press charges for supplying alcohol to a minor.... no kid wants to put their &quot;friend&quot; on the hook. Also, the friend may think that alcohol is not a big deal......but in this case - with the other drugs it is.

Yes pot stays in the system for a while. I don't believe that acid shows up in drug screening -- could be wrong. Ecstasy for just a short time. The kids really like the sensory of ecstasy experience but the new brain research shows that ecstasy has some long term effects on the brain; these are showing up as significant memory deficits at middle age.....you might share this fact with him. Further, this research is from the aging literature and not the anti-drug and so your son might consider the source a little more valid.....

My kids got sick of me saying that I did everything for healthy brain development during pregnancy and was going to see it through their teen years since the brain is still developing (they can actually see time lapsed imaging of the teen brain pruning synapses...very cool stuff!)

The questionnaires should only be given by people licensed to give, interpret and share the result. Also, tests are a dime a dozen, so be sure that it is the most appropriate diagnostic tool. Be sure to understand what the test can and CANNOT do. Consider asking your counselor/doctor/psychiatrist about any recommendations.

Finally, it is interesting to me that he is using drugs that have a lot of sensory attributes.....is this filling a neurological need, or social (boredom, fitting in and using the drug de jour) or escaping because of personal stress/depression????? He may not know and once again, here's hoping you find a good counselor.

This is a tough time - hang in there!

This is such an unsettling time for you and your family and my prayers go out to you. Do you (or Todd's father) have a decent relationship with him? Do you talk? Is he involved in sports? Cars/bikes? Do you know his friends by first name? How about his comings and goings? Are you aware of where he is and who he is with? I ask you this because this will help you both with this situation.
The tell-tale signs of the drugs vary with drug type and volume of use. Pot stays in your system the longest but can be flushed enough (with water and frequent urination) in order to pass the drug test. Other signs of pot use is the obvious; the smell, blood-shot eyes, sluggishness, increased appetite (the munchies), apathy. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior- sleeping more or less, different choice of music, different group of friends, loss of interest in usual activities, secretiveness. Most hallucinegenic drugs such as acid and ecstacy will give way to visual changes; fixation on lights and spinning objects. His pupils will most likely be large and dilated. These drugs are very sensory oriented- sight, sound, and touch are heightened. Acid and ex are very dangerous (all of them are for that matter) as most of these are synthetic and are therefor a mixture that can be lethal. You never know what you are taking or how your body will respond- it's like playing russian roulette. I do know that your personal psychological state at the time directly impacts the &quot;high&quot;. I knew someone in high school who was very stressed and he &quot;dropped&quot; some acid and had a bad &quot;trip&quot;- he has never been the same- it permanently affected his psyche- in otherwords, he went out of his mind! Teens these days are also into prescription drugs (percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, ritalin, adderal, etc.) They will also use inhalants (aerosol spray cans).
If you feel in your gut that there is a problem, seek help. I haven't checked out the support groups on this web site but there are groups in the community that can help. It's tough because of the teenage denial thing. At this point it's a matter of life and death!
My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

Thanks for all your support. I can't believe it's August and we are still at the tip of the iceberg with this drug thing. My husband and I have had Todd tested both in and outside a lab and some were negative and some positive. We still didn't have a handle on it (still working on it) but an incident at the local park in June(left his backpack with name in it with drug paraphernalia)caused him to be charged with possession. We needed all the help we could get to move forward with this because our son was spinning out of control.
Yes....his music &amp; friends changed, yes--his behavior changed, yes...he's been very secretive...all adding up. Had our court date last night for two different incidents... He ALMOST delayed the drug possession and there might have been a chance that he could have gotten off. I was sweating...big time! We convinced him to plead guilty. Because he did we were able to get a court order drug test...hair sample! My son says that he would have had a clean test with the urine sample but not the hair sample. He said he stopped once he was caught and hasn't had any drugs since. I find that hard to believe. He may not have had drugs but I know he's drinking quite regularly. I can't wait until the assessment. This whole thing is taking way too long. Thankfully, he was caught because he HAD to cooperate with the testing. We have an appt. (my husband and I) with a drug counselor today. **Part of the reason my son is where he's at is because we were so focused on our other son who was fighting depression. We struggled with him and my youngest watched our every move. Another reason is that my husband and I were not on the same page. My husband overrode me a lot. I told him time and time again that he can't do that but he didn't listen. He is now! I'm so proud of him. And myself for getting it through to him.87

I was asked a question by an individual whowas asking about Meds. I have omitted his/her name and will do so for anyone who asks me a question. I posted this in my journal, because I think I overdid the amount of information I gave, and felt that others could learn some stuff about what their taking.

Exclusively the new EMSAM drug that has come out this past year. Very few people have experiance with this drug, and doctors will be reluctant to use the drug do to the class of drugs it belongs in. However, this reluctance should, and will be slowly overcome because of its unique approach that reduces the risks associated with other drugs of its type. I have included a LARGE amount of information about all sorts of drugs, and I hope it inspires people to learn more about what there taking and ask maybe get them to ask questions to your doctor about what your drugs do.

Not that type of drug, though I have more then enough information and experiance on the short term and long term implications of this disease.

The truth is, for paranoia, and anxiety... Marijuana works great for around 5-6 years, then it turns against you and you find yourself in dire straights. I tell you its not a good place to be in. The medication perscribed by the doctor does NOT have this time period. It keeps working for many many months. The only thing is, that finding the right med is hard and long. You want to experiment, constantly... take notes... and keep triing new ones... there is allot to try, and sometimes a single drug can eliminate an entire class of drugs for you. This will shorten the time period for it.

Its not an easy process. After 12 years of this, I can say that I am as stable as any &quot;Normal&quot; person. Finally.88

I'm a clean kid. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't have sex, I don't do drugs and I generally don't hang out with those who do. Where I'm from there aren't a lot of LGBT kids and but there is this one bi guy who is pretty cool. He was the one who I could talk about things with. He recently switched schools and I thought it would be good for him because he was in trouble at school and his home life was pretty rough and it would be good to get away from his sibs. (they still go to my school) He smokes, he drinks and he does drugs. He enjoys sex with anyone who will give it to him. Right after Christmas he overdosed. By some miracle he survived. I knew he was going to get into trouble but I didn't do anything. I didn't realize that he had hit rock bottom again. I've barely seen him this year and I can't believe this. I'm having trouble dealing with this. It scares me because I feel like I should have done something even though I haven't seen him and didn't know how bad things were. I've delt with a lot of shit this year and this is one I just don't know what to do about because I hate drugs and I don't approve of those who use them and I refuse to hang out with him if he's drunk or high and he's like my only friend who does drugs. I'm just freaking out a little bit and I hope that everything works out but I just don't know if it will

well i lost a lot of people to drugs.i smoke and i drink but im nt sloppy about it as i was.does it make it OK? no.but its my way of coping.as for him he can only help him self we are all given choices no matter what fucked off life we have.he has the choice to get his shit together and all you can do is support and try to be there.and if he cant appreciate that then you should just say fuck it.friends come and go.you can be the realist friend and no matter what one of your friends wont give a fuck.just stay focused on your self.don't put your self in other peoples bullshit because its more complications for you.all you can do is SUPPORT.and he probably needs a lot of it.for all that you do that is good it pays off in the end.i was a real fucked up terrible horrible person with a huge heart and it sure paid off when i found it.yeah you'll worrie but what can you do?nothing.they have to change.you cant make them.=[..but stay strong.89

i have used marijuana. i believe it should be legal for medicinal purposes. i believe it helps my mania. to calm me down. it doesnt help me or i dont really desire it either if i am moderately or severely depressed. if i am mildly depressed tho, it may or may not help my mood. i am honest about my usage with my pdoc and mytdoc.

Believe it or not, I lived through the '60's never using drugs....not even grass. I was already messed up enough without adding street drugs to my problems. I have come to believe that psychiatric drugs, under the supervision of a Doctor of course, are the only way to try and get mental illnesses under control.

Okay - I think we've all seen the ads for drugs on TV - the ones that will help with RA or Psoriasis - or other conditions. After announcing what they will do for you - they give you a litany of the damages they can cause you, often times including cancer or death. The trade-off always strikes me as a bit too severe.

Okay - and I think we've all seen the ads by lawyers for "bad drugs" telling us that certain drugs have cause many problems and diseases - some of those being cancer and death.

We can get these drugs fairly easily by merely obtaining a prescription from a physician.

BUT - I bought some antihistamines at the drug store the other day and i had to sign a special form that is submitted to the government for people who buy antihistamines. Apparently an ingredient in antihistamines is used to make drugs that are dangerous for us.

Shouldn't the government be taking the drugs that are prescribed for us - a bit more seriously? The selective attitude, on the part of the government, is a little confusing and I suppose one has to follow the money to figure this one out. I just find this to be a bit curious.91

Has anyone had any luck with finding alternate programs for copay assistance with biologics?

Here's the deal. I saw my rheumy Monday, and we agreed to give Orencia a try. They gave me a copay card, and I called to register it. The woman on the phone and I were getting along just fine until she asked me to state that I am indeed being treated for moderate to severe RA. I told her that I actually seem to have PsA, not RA, and that was the end of it- no benefits available.

She hinted that I might want to try again another time on another call, but I'm not sure about that. I was running around today getting a chest x-ray and TB test, and the diagnosis codes on those forms were quite specific: PsA. I don't know if the pharmacy gets diagnosis codes. I don't know what, if any, penalty there would be for "misunderstanding" the question and answering in the affirmative, but I just don't want to go there. Am I being stupid?

Has anyone found meaningful financial help from other sources? I don't actually have insurance approval yet, and I don't know what my copay would be, but I can imagine. Even without the kids in college thing it probably wouldn't be possible.

Just through the drug company patience assistance program. I received Humira through them for 10mo.

But I know Humira and Enbrel are both used for dx other than RA. I didn't realize Orencia wasn't. But it must be or your Dr wouldn't have written it for you right? Have you already tried Enbrel?

Someone on a FB forum today said her co pay for Orencia was $800. That's ridiculous. Who can afford to pay that? As much as these bios cost they should come with a nurse to administer the damn shot.

I'm am diagnose with UCTD I also got the copay card when they asked it I had RA I said yes I asked my Doctor about it and he said if was fine I used it a few times but orencia made me tired I am now on Actemra.

if the orencia co-pay people had pushed it thought for you Orencia would have paid your ENTIRE co-pay up to 12 times per year maximum of $4,000 of the uncovered copay with you paying only $5.00 per month

so yeah, you needed that copay assistance program to go through........

i had a problem with them also at first. Massachusetts used to have a prohibition in place for co pay programs right around when I went onto orencia but our state house passed a bill with an immediate effective date to over turn that legislation and make co pay programs legal shortly before I enrolled.

what i like to call &quot;the voice on the phone&quot; couldn't get that i knew the bill, had written and called my state senator and that no their website interface program for enrollment was wrong.

so maybe at Orencia could tell your doctor why ONLY RA is a supported diagnosis for co-pay assistance?

part of me would like you to have your MD return a dual diagnosis with RA on it to just get this ball rolling

the voice on the phone has a script, he is just reading stop/go questions and then they hit a wall and can't troubleshoot.

can you google this query and see if anyone else had this issue with diagnosis? not sure whey they are only supporting one type of auto immune dx

orencia is only used to treat ra; treatment for psa may be a common off-label usage, but it's not noted on their website. if the person on the phone hinted at calling back and speaking to someone else, i'd think that means that they aren't going to come back at you if you don't have ra and try to recoup the monies.

having said that, i believe pharmacies will see icd9 codes, so they could determine the diagnosis. it may be worth a call to your doctor to see if they can 'add' ra to your diagnosis, just to cover everyone's butts.

I struggle with the same thing altoclef - I'm too honest - to the point that is what actually cost me loosing my Humira for the past 2 months.

I was approved for free Humira from the Abvie Foundation through this coming May. When I procured insurance last November, I told my doc that I was going to stop the free stuff from the foundation and to please start the pre-authorization process for Humia (which at the time was on their formulary list). Now because of the blunders of my doc's office, I never received it through the insurance.

Tough call weather to call back and say &quot;yes&quot; to if you have RA. A decision like that would keep my up at night thinking weather I should do it or not.........

sammyo1 2 years ago
That's senseless. If the med treats your form of arthritis then what does it matter? Obviously it's approved to treat yours or the doctor would not have prescribed.
The new mail order pharmacy gave me a few numbers to call for assistance with Orencia. I'd be happy to try to locate those for you.

As to what to say with a second call, that's a hard one.
Your doctors office gave you the card so maybe put a call into them &amp; let them know the problem your having. They may recommend a way to deal with it.
With the cost of these meds I don't get why it has to be so difficult.
If I can help please let me know.
Good luck, Sammy

Thanks for all the replies.

Orencia i currently only approved for RA, and I'm not sure that will change. After hurting my brain with too much computer, too many technical articles, it looks like it did well in trials for psoriatic joint involvement, but kind of, shall we say, sucked at clearing skin. Many PsA patients have heavy skin involvement, so the suckage there is a deal-breaker. Makes it not worth the time and money to win approval.

I emailed my doc about this through the patient portal. Any communication there is part of my records. She, naturally, said she couldn't advise me to call them back and have a different answer ready. She's a bit hard to read in person, harder in writing, so I'm not sure what she thinks. With her income, she most likely doesn't understand the limits of mine.

PsA was only fairly recently split off from RA- maybe 40 years ago. Within my lifetime.

Sammy, if you do still have those numbers, please pass them on.

Now I never called any of the above. Via Jen I googled for Orencia's
Number &amp; applied through the co pay program.
You know these meds are so darn expensive you may want to try giving the RA diagnosis.
It's not as though your taking $$, your simply wanting help the same as the rest of us.
I'm thinking there are those doctors that don't realize the cost to patients.
I hope these things change &amp; if a drug is prescribed &amp; helps it gets the same consideration with financial help.
Hope you can find the help you need. Good luck

I just got a call from my insurance company. They have approved the prescription- I was a bit concerned about that, as it's off-label for my use.

When would you like it shipped? Where to? Any questions? Need any supplies? Oh, by the way, we applied for a co-pay card for you, so it will be $5. Sure, we can bill you for that. Problem solved.

I'm a little concerned about this new (to me) insurance company. They answer the phone promptly, they talk to you nicely, they know what they are doing. Their benefits are great, and nothing is a problem for them. My old one spent so much time trying to make my life difficult, rejecting claims, etc., this just doesn't feel right!92

Ok...I'm on 150 mg. of Zoloft (for about 2 weeks now). I was wondering if anyone has tried any other medication with Zoloft for relief from depression. I have seen Abilify advertised on TV, but when I look up the reviews online, it doesn't look like something I'd like to try. Side effects seem awful.

Thanks!

I tried Wellbutrin with Zoloft, but didn't get any more improvement in depression than from Zoloft alone.

I know I wouldn't try Abilify because it is, too my understanding, an anti-psychotic medication not originally intended for depression. I have seen people with tardive dyskensia, one of the possible side effects of Abilify, and that is such a serious and irreversible side effect that I would not risk it.

Does Zoloft seem to be helping you? It's possible that you haven't taken it long enough yet to have experienced its full effect.

Erin, that's a decision only you can make. Your profile does not say anything about how old you are or where you are at in your life and you have to take all of that into consideration.

The drugs are expensive. They do not cure MS, they only slow down its progression by reducing the number of attacks that you have. The younger you are when you have your attacks, the longer your disease has to work on you and do more damage.

I had my first discernable attack in 1998. I did not have anything else happen again until 2005. That is a very common story with everybody here. Don't delude yourself into thinking it has gone away or that you have a &quot;light&quot; case of it. It's a SNEAKY BASTARD OF A DISEASE.

I now have a permanent limp, I have fallen a couple of times and broken two bones on the foot of my affected leg. I just started to use a cane.

Would it be different if I had been dx'd earlier and started on the drugs? Who knows? That's the worst thing about it.

You are doing the right thing by coming here and getting different takes on things. Get yourself educated, make a decision that is right for you.

Best of luck to you.

LilMargie says it best... Only YOU can decide for yourself. I was dx in 1993 and was on betaseron when my number came up in the lottery (yeah, that's how it was done in the beginning of the MS drugs that are now availble; back then, beta was the only game in town). I was on beta over 8 years until it ate the tissue under my skin and left me with a pretty 4&quot; scar on my right thigh... Ugh...

I have been on no drugs for the MS except 1000 IU Vit. D since 2003 when I quit betaseron. Right now, I'm trying to get on Copaxone, but can't afford the co-pays so I'm letting the Universe decide (I'm on the list for programs).

I also focus on FAITH not FEAR with this disease. Yes, I am very much a Polly Anna, but it has served me well with MS which I've had over 14 years... If you have any questions, send me a message! xoxoxo Cj (Cindyjo)

I agree with LilMargie. Much of what this disease does is silent, you show no symptoms, but damage is still being done. It's something you must give a great deal of thought to from all sides.
As LilMargie said, they don't cure, but slow the disease down. I don't like shots, but would hate having to depend on others more. For now it's about the only FDA proven way to really fight back.
Good luck to you friend!

Im in the same boat with you erin. I have never had a symptom of MS but because of the spinal tap and MRI, they diagnosed me with it. So they want to put me on drugs because &quot;early treatment&quot; is a good idea. I havn't started yet but its hard to agree to start taking injections, if I run 6km a day and feel great. Especially when they say the drugs are about 33% effective at slowing the disease. I think only you should decide because you are the one who will have to play the &quot;what if&quot; scenario 10 or 20 years down the road.

When i was first diagnosed I was in denial of course and chose not to take the reccommended drug. I was ok for a couple months after my first relapse and then I got hit real hard. I was a mess for about a year experiencing attack after attack. I was scared of all the listed side effects that I would likely get if I used Rebif. Instead I tried a herbal route with no success. After that tough year I decided I better get with the Rebif. I did and my only regret was not starting it when they told me to.

Post:
My boyfriend have been in a relationship for about 4 years. When we started dating, he was my knight in shining armor- literally. I really needed help and had no one and he came to help. He moved me across country with my pet, found me a place to live, and helped me with every single thing. He liked to help me fix things.

I had a very hard time for 2 years. I was in college, had no family (he helped me move because my dad wouldn't help at the last minute and the reason i was going BACK to where I started was because dad wanted to be in my life...). I have diagnosed BiPolar and Asperger's (not formally diagnosed). I know things were hard.

He liked to help me. He was the only person I had. We've had really good times.

Things have gotten better since then for me. But things between us have been more and more strained. As well as his relationships with other friends, etc.

He always smoked pot. I don't have a problem with this. The health risks are not worse than drinking (not up for argument- not the point). However, he also did things like LSD, acid, Ecstacy, Nitris (whippets), shrooms, and I'm sure others. It wasn't often. Then he said he wanted to stop. Then he did it again "only sometimes, with friends", and stopped saying he needed to. He threw out everything. He only smoked pot rarely.

Now he's back in. Only now, instead of smoking once or twice a week, it's far more. He showed all his friends nitris and they did it a lot. He ordered a case. He partook in other activities that would have gotten us in serious trouble (my name is on bills).

He HAS to do everything bigger and better than EVERYONE. If someone has a glass piece, he needs a $500 piece. If someone spends $30 on alcohol, he goes and buys Don Julio.

He now does MDMA(?) which is I guess a form of ecstacy that was originally used by psychiatrists in getting patients to open up (similar to "truth serum"). MDMA was banned because of the threat it posed to patients. He thinks it lets us connect emotionally and lets him get in touch with himself.

He went to some festival thing this past weekend. Apparently it's 36 hours of people doing psychadelics and sharing "an experience" with other people, music, etc. on a private hippie-type living area. He said his phone was low battery and that's why he didn't tell me he wouldn't be home for 3 days. I had no idea, but figured. He hasn't been coming home when he is with his friends doing drugs.

He slept in all day monday saying he didn't have to work because he owns the company with the other guy and could work from home.

He is excessively aggressive after such outings. Everything said is a perceived threat. Everything is an attack. He refuses, out of "principle" to do anything- even things he says he'll do that were his idea. For example, we tried eating dinner together. He didn't want to put clean dishes away. I said ok, i'll do it AS LONG as you put the dishes in the sink away/wash them.

It's been 2 days. He is purposely not doing it because he'll "Do it later when HE decides to." Then I need to do it and he says "well I SAID I would do it.

He is now using the word "bitch" in conversations. Every single conversation that uses an adjective is preceeded by the "f-word" or other term, when I am very against that. he is belittling me, putting me down, etc.

He wants no conversation he doesn't initiate. He only wants what he wants (including any intimacy) without giving.

He says he doesn't know who he is, where he is going, etc. and needs to find out. His solution is to get rid of everyone around him, get rid of possessions, sell his car, and be on his own. He sounds suicidal (and to other people) but has no indication of intent or desire to hurt himself. He thinks of himself as a god.

He broke up with me, saying he doesn't love me (a week ago) and couldn't remember the last time he did. But....a week prior to that he was starting to cry telling me he loved me because I am leaving for a month to study abroad. He isn't broken up with me because I convinced him after a lot of conversation, crying, etc. to just try to see through this and not make a decision like this.

He goes in cycles throughout the year. He will have very elevated moods (maybe mania) and want to do everything. Make a good life, etc and be happy. Then he gets like this, where he is still good at work, but overly competitive and pushes people away. And then brings them back in later when he feels better.

This relationship is becoming unhealthy and I thought I was the problem with mental issues, but now I've been completely stable for 2 years, have had no issues, and am progressing again. I've been successful.

This recent cycle started about 2 weeks before his birthday, when he decided he didn't like where he is but doesn't know where he's going.

Is this a drug problem, though it doesn't require rehab or professional intervention? Is this primarily psychological? Can I help him? Though I love him terribly, is there no hope?

Thanks.

Drug addiction is a progressive disease. At first you can use occasionally then slowly you start to use more frequently and other type drugs, eventually it starts to cause problems into your life.
He is a addict and it sounds like he is willing to experience anything which is dangerous. He hasn't lost you ir his work so its all party fun time.
Is there hope? If he see he has a problem and is willing to get help addicts have a better success rate.
As for intervention some are for it some aren't. I am for it nothing ventured, nothing gain. Even if he doesn't get and stay clean he learns alittle about drug addiction and it plants the seed for later should he decide to get and stay clean.
The main thing is know his behavior is out of your control and you need to do what is best for you.

From reading your story I think that he sounds as if he may have the start of a drug addiction. He may have abused drugs for many years, used them because he liked the way they made him feel and then later on like you said using harder stuff which caused the problems.

Check out this webpage:http://helpguide.org/mental/drug_substance_abuse_addiction_signs_effects_treatment.htm
See the section Common signs and symptoms of drug abuse/addicts, are these the symptoms he has?

Reading the above artical helped me realise my boyfriend had a drug addiction. When we were younger we used to smoke a little pot nothing drastic, just an experiment like most teenagers. I gave up and have never had any since but my boyfriend carried on, this was the stage when he started to abuse drugs (at the time I had no idea). 4 years down the line he is now a full blown addict and does harsher drugs every day. He is in huge amounts of debt and lies to me every single day. The addiction has took over his life, and mine.

My advice to you would be identify the issues as soon as possible and then do what you feel is right. If I had realised this 4 years ago It would have been so much easier to end our relationship but now it's really difficult as I am so in love with him.

We had a talk/fight. He told me he thinks he has a problem. He has a problem with the drugs and doesn't want to do them anymore.

But he also told me he has a problem when he's not on drugs- he can't feel happy. He feels there is always something there. He's obviously self-medicating.

He says he will NEVER take medication and have his life ruled by them. He won't be one of those people.

Keep in mind, this destructive cycle keeps happening and his friends notice, even though I don't speak with them. He's depressed and searching for something, then extremely high and productive (though he is successful and competitive always).

He isn't happy with himself, doesn't know what he wants, but said he's not in love with me a little over 2 weeks ago and is now desiring attention and intimacy (i.e. company, holding me, etc).

Last night he was very happy to see me and cuddle me when he got to bed and was loving this morning. Today he &quot;wants space&quot; and came home and immediately left. I asked if we could do something another day and he said &quot;I don't know. Maybe.&quot; He's avoiding me. We had no fights. Maybe I shouldn't text him at all or call?

I'm leaving to study abroad in Japan for a month...I want to spend time with him. When I told him he asked &quot;So you want to spend time with me now because you're leaving for Japan?&quot; In a way that made it sound like it was the only reason.

Is he pushing me away because he'll miss me? He says he's NOT mad, but needs space. He's smoking pot daily.

What is going on here?

I'm now having panic attacks. I have asperger's and bipolar, which have been completely under control for 2 years. Under extreme stress I have panic attack problems that can last for weeks and I get sick. I'm feeling sick now and went to the store to buy valerian (natural nerves soother). I still don't feel better, but don't want to ask doctor for meds because they might not let me leave for Japan.

Help. =(

The reason he isn't happy when not on drugs is because he has used drugs so long that his feeling are numb. It will take along time of not using to get his endorphins and his brain chemistry working right up to 5 years. His emotions will be all over the place for along time. Just know its nothing you've done.
When you have a panic attack shug it off, you brain will rewire itself. I used to have them and started shugging them off and don't have them anymore. I know it is a horrible feeling but shug it off and change your thinking right away. Its works.

P4R4DOX, I'm sorry that you're going through this. It sounds to me that he needs help, both with drug addiction and mental health. He may have a disorder that only a professional can diagnose. It's probably a good thing that you're going abroad. Someimes it's healthy fo us to seperate ourselves from the situation/person so that we can make decisions.

Okay.. one thing.. Read your post again and again and again. What about his behavior makes you believe anything about this is normal?
if not normal, what about his behavior is okay... it's abusive, it's manipulative, it's controlling . it's deceitful - anything but okay.
One thought comes to mind. &quot;high tolerance for inappropriate behavior.&quot;
Stop worrying about him, get some counseling for you, attend Alanon.
Focus on yourself. His behavior is a one-way street - dead end.
Take care of yourself and have a great experience in Japan.

At the very end of your post, you said &quot;though it doesn't require rehab or professional intervention&quot;.

Why would you say that?

If it's a drug problem with or without an accompanying mental illness, then rehab and/or professional intervention is exactly what's needed.

You can't simply wish or love addiction away. It requires treatment. It's a disease.95

Well, I know that ciagettes and caffeine and alcohol is bad for PKD patients. The marijuana I have no clue about the effects. I have heard that the caffeine makes the cysts grow faster. I am not sure if there is research to back that up or not. My doctor told me so I am taking his word for it. The cigarettes elevate your blood pressure which I do know for a fact is the worste thing for your kidneys. Control your blood pressure always. If its good keep checking on it regularly, if its high get on meds asap. If you are on meds make sure you check to always make sure its a normal read. Stay on top of your blood pressure. I dont know why the alcohol is bad, I just know it is. Maybe it elevates your BP as well.

Once a dialysis tech told me that they can always tell which patients smoke pot because it raises the hemoglobin number. Don't know if that's true!

Vices vs. Life. You choose.

Food is another restriction. Don't eat anything in extremes. Bitter, sweet, salty, or spicy (especially spicy!). Anything that can cause a bump in BP should be avoided. You'll have to keep it dull, but that doesn't mean boring.

I prefer natural meds to chemical meds. I spent 4 months with a chinese doctor to bring a 156/92 to a consistant average of 135/82.

Here's what I found on the net.
10 tricks to lower your blood pressure
1. Check it
You can't do much about your blood pressure unless you know what it is. Your doctor should check it at every visit. Measuring at home between visits is even better.
2. Get moving
Exercise can lower bp by 10 points, prevent the onset of high bp or let you reduce your dosage of bp meds.
3. Eat right
A diet for better bp emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts.
4. Control you weight
If you are overweight, losing weight can lower bp.
5. Don't smoke
Smoking a cigarette can cause a 20 point spike in systolic bp.
6. Drink alcohol in moderation
Going beyond a drink a day can contribute to higher bp.
7. Shake up your salts
Too much sodium and too little potassium can boost bp. Aim for less than 1.5 grams of sodium a day and at least 4.7g of potassium from fruits and vegetables.
8. Sleep is good
Chronic lack of sleep can contribute to high bp. Get at least 6 hours a night.
9. Reduce stress
Mental and emotional stress can raise bp. Meditation and deep breathing can lower it.
10. Stick with your meds
Taking med can keep you from having a stroke or heart attack.

Also, low-fat milk on a low-fat diet lowers bp. Diet or regular cola, not coffee, can increase the risk of high bp especially in women. Worst day of the week is Monday (stress from starting the work week). Cranberry juice supports urinary function (which supports kidney function).

Addressing the symptoms, will delay the disease but it's no cure. Just stay as healthy as you can.

I forgot to mention that your new buddy is named H2O. More water equals less stress on your kidneys (also means going to the bathroom more).

I have tryed many things. Most likley just about everything execpt a few. Lucky never to have a real long time problem with any of them. Some only tryed one time. I have smoked pot for a few months and then quit for years and then for a few months. But now I can't even do that because it gives me panic attacks.

i was manic for 2 months, during which i got drunk every single night because i decided to go to a bar every single night and blow off steam. luckily, i didn't/don't have an alcohol problem, i guess it just falls under the category &quot;things I wouldn't normally do.&quot;97

I was asked a question by an individual whowas asking about Meds. I have omitted his/her name and will do so for anyone who asks me a question. I posted this in my journal, because I think I overdid the amount of information I gave, and felt that others could learn some stuff about what their taking.

Exclusively the new EMSAM drug that has come out this past year. Very few people have experiance with this drug, and doctors will be reluctant to use the drug do to the class of drugs it belongs in. However, this reluctance should, and will be slowly overcome because of its unique approach that reduces the risks associated with other drugs of its type. I have included a LARGE amount of information about all sorts of drugs, and I hope it inspires people to learn more about what there taking and ask maybe get them to ask questions to your doctor about what your drugs do.

Not that type of drug, though I have more then enough information and experiance on the short term and long term implications of this disease.

The truth is, for paranoia, and anxiety... Marijuana works great for around 5-6 years, then it turns against you and you find yourself in dire straights. I tell you its not a good place to be in. The medication perscribed by the doctor does NOT have this time period. It keeps working for many many months. The only thing is, that finding the right med is hard and long. You want to experiment, constantly... take notes... and keep triing new ones... there is allot to try, and sometimes a single drug can eliminate an entire class of drugs for you. This will shorten the time period for it.

Its not an easy process. After 12 years of this, I can say that I am as stable as any &quot;Normal&quot; person. Finally.98
